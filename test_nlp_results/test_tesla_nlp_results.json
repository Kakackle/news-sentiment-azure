What will happen following Thursday\u2019s wet weather? CNN - Money Apple and Google restore TikTok to their US app stores By CNN Newsource Published February 13, 2025 5:37 PM By Ramishah Maruf and Clare Duffy, CNN New York (CNN) \u2014 Google Play said it restored TikTok to the US app store on Thursday, following promises by President Donald Trump to save the app and an executive action delaying the enactment of a ban on the wildly popular social media platform. Bloomberg and CNBC also reported that Apple will restore the app to its app store on Thursday evening. TikTok was available on app stores as of Thursday evening, according to CNN attempts to download the app on different phones. TikTok\u2019s uncertain future stems from a law signed last April by then-President Joe Biden, which gave China\u2019s ByteDance 270 days to sell the app to an owner from the United States or one of its allies or face a ban, based on US national security concerns. The day before the blackout, the Supreme Court upheld the ban. TikTok shut down for roughly 14 hours in January but attributed its quick return to promises made by the then president-elect Donald Trump to keep the platform working in the US. But its 175 million users still ran into at least one problem: The app was, as of that January weekend, unavailable on Apple and Google Play stores, along with Lemon8 and CapCut, which are also owned by TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company, ByteDance. Apple previously said in a statement it removed TikTok from the app store because of the ban, but the app remained available for customers who already downloaded it. Tech companies faced consequences Trump signaled before taking office that he would sign an executive action delaying enforcement of the ban and TikTok had credited him for the reason the app came back. \u201cI will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post on January 19. He added that he would not hold TikTok\u2019s technology partners \u2014 including Apple, Google and cloud computing company Oracle \u2014 liable for continuing to make the app available until he signed the order. The law required only that TikTok\u2019s technology partners \u2014 including Oracle, which hosts TikTok\u2019s content in the United States, and Apple and Google, which host the app on their app stores \u2014 stop supporting the app or face fines of up to $5,000 per person who has access to the platform starting Sunday. Trump took office the next day, on January 20. He signed the executive order later that day, giving TikTok another 75 days to find a new owner. Trump\u2019s promises to save TikTok The action says the 75-day delay would help the Trump administration attempt to \u201cdetermine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans. \u201d Trump told reporters that he changed his mind on TikTok because he \u201cgot to use it. \u201d \u201cAnd remember, ",

By Jibin Joseph Feb 14, 2025 (Credit: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) Google Maps is adding more options to its incident-reporting feature, which will allow drivers to avoid or prepare for dangerous weather conditions. As spotted by Android Police, Maps now allows users to flag flooded roads, low visibility, and unplowed roads. The new incident types first appeared on Android Auto before showing up on iOS, but it does not appear to be available on Android yet. Google Maps' new weather-related incident reports on iOS(Credit: PCMag)Incident reporting has been a standout feature on Waze, which Google acquired in 2013. It allows users to report crashes, incorrect directions, police checks, and more. For a long time, Google Maps couldn\u2019t match the quality of the reporting on its own Maps app, which mainly showed alerts for congestion, crashes, or roadwork. Last year, Google added community-driven Waze incident reports to Maps, allowing users to spot a \"police ahead\" report from Waze on Maps. Users\u2019 responses to incident reporting have been divided. While some like the important warnings they receive, others opine that too many alerts could be distracting. \u201cEvery couple of minutes a warning (incident report) pops up asking about a stalled car, roadworks. Asking me to confirm if the issue is still there. Every time this stops the music playing. I have to swipe into the YouTube Music app and hit play again,\u201d complained a Redditor. One drawback of the feature is that once users flag an issue, Maps will ask every driver passing by if the issue persists. If too many drivers don\u2019t respond, the app could show the alert even after it\u2019s been resolved.

This project will make it easy for travelers from around the world to size up the beauty and wonders of The Bahamas from wherever they are. \u201d The project will see several street view-equipped vehicles with mounted camera systems roaming roadways throughout the islands to capture more than 2,000,000 geolocated 360-degree images for showcasing the country on Google Maps. The Bahamas Street View Coverage for Google Maps is proposed to capture imagery of more than 3,729 miles (6,000 kilometres) of key tourist areas throughout the country\u2019s more than 700 islands, including 16 major islands featuring towns, beaches and other attractions that are visited by millions of in-coming travelers. With the imagery capture, The Bahamas will join more than 100 countries and territories currently featured, in whole or in part, on the Street View function of Google Maps, which enables users to explore settings around the world via 360-degree images. The function is among the most popular features of applications on Google Maps, enabling users to effortlessly plan visits, observe attractions, pinpoint restaurants and hotels and more, using the convenience of technologies including mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Among a host of popular tourist areas proposed to be photographed through the Street View Project are Downtown Nassau and Montagu Beach in Nassau; Port Lucaya Marketplace and Peterson Cay National Park in Grand Bahama; and Marsh Harbour, Green Turtle Cay and Cherokee Sound in The Abacos. Street View is not for vacation planning alone, but benefits of imagery-captured ranges from support for urban planning and emergency response, to historical preservation and environmental conservation. Special considerations are also being made to increase public awareness of the Street View Project locally in The Bahamas, as well as for the mapping of sensitive areas and special restrictions and permission for capturing images in public areas. Director General of Tourism Latia Duncombe also weighed in on the digital project. \u201cIn today\u2019s digital landscape, immersive experiences are key to attracting travelers,\u201d she said. \u201cThis Google Street View initiative is a game-changer for Bahamian tourism. By bringing our islands to life on Google Maps, we\u2019re not just showcasing our beauty, we\u2019re making The Bahamas more accessible than ever before. \u201dAdded the director general, \u201cPotential visitors can explore our diverse offerings virtually in the palm of their hands, igniting their desire to visit and experience the authentic wonder of our islands firsthand. This initiative also presents a tremendous opportunity for local businesses \u2014 restaurants, hotels, and attractions \u2014 by increasing their visibility to a global audience and making it easier for travelers to discover and support them before they even arrive. \u201d (BIS Photos/Kemuel Stubbs) SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePrime Minister Davis terms Signing of MOU with the Dundas Centre a \u2018landmark occasion\u2019Next articleAnother high school teacher charged with assaulting a 15-year-old boy\u2026 media RELATED ARTICLESMORE FRO",

S. stock indexes drifted following mixed profit reports from big companies. The S&P 500 barely budged and slipped by less than 0. 1%, a day after rallying within 0. 1% of its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 165 points, or 0. 4%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0. 4%. The S&P 500 still closed out its first winning week in the last three thanks in part to reports showing companies made even fatter profits at the end of 2024 than analysts expected. They\u2019ve helped the market power through a range of worries centered on higher interest rates and stubborn inflation. Airbnb climbed 14. 4% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected as customers booked more nights on its platform. Wynn Resorts jumped 10. 4% after likewise topping earnings expectations, thanks in part to strength for its Las Vegas operations. TikTok returns to Apple and Google app storesTikTok has returned to the app stores of Apple and Google in the U. S. , after President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a TikTok ban. TikTok, which is operated by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, was removed from Apple and Google\u2019s app stores on Jan. 18 to comply with a law that requires ByteDance to divest the app or be banned in the U. S. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the company\u2019s move on Friday. Apple did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

S. stock indexes drifted following mixed profit reports from big companies. The S&P 500 barely budged and slipped by less than 0. 1%, a day after rallying within 0. 1% of its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 165 points, or 0. 4%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0. 4%. The S&P 500 still closed out its first winning week in the last three thanks in part to reports showing companies made even fatter profits at the end of 2024 than analysts expected. They\u2019ve helped the market power through a range of worries centered on higher interest rates and stubborn inflation. Airbnb climbed 14. 4% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected as customers booked more nights on its platform. Wynn Resorts jumped 10. 4% after likewise topping earnings expectations, thanks in part to strength for its Las Vegas operations. TikTok returns to Apple and Google app storesTikTok has returned to the app stores of Apple and Google in the U. S. , after President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a TikTok ban. TikTok, which is operated by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, was removed from Apple and Google\u2019s app stores on Jan. 18 to comply with a law that requires ByteDance to divest the app or be banned in the U. S. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the company\u2019s move on Friday. Apple did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Print More than a decade ago, outcries about the lack of diversity in the tech industry reverberated across major Silicon Valley companies from Facebook to Google. Women and minorities spoke out about feeling out of place in male-dominated professions, civil rights activists urged businesses to do more and tech workers like Tracy Chou, who was a software engineer at Pinterest at the time, pushed companies to release diversity data. \u201cThere was already some movement in that direction, at least a feeling like we should do this,\u201d said Chou, who wrote a viral Medium post in 2013 about the lack of female engineers. \u201cWhat I happened to crystallize was a line of thinking that really resonated with the more data-driven side of the industry. \u201d Advertisement For diversity advocates like Chou, the tide has now turned.

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. PCMag UK News The Best Presidents' Day Deals at Woot: Save on Apple, JBL, Google, More You get to save up to 70% at Woot heading into this three-day weekend. Celebrate the holiday with some of the biggest tech brands with even bigger price cuts. By Gabriela Vatu Feb 15, 2025 (PCMag/Woot) Presidents' Day is just around the corner, and it's a fantastic time to pick up some incredible deals on your favorite tech at Woot. Now, we need to remind you that Woot's deals are a bit different than what we see elsewhere because these discounts only last until the stock runs out or the deal expires (whichever happens first). So, let's kick things off by checking out the best early Presidents' Day we found, and don't forget to come back and check for more deals as we update this story on the reg! Woot Presidents' Day Speaker DealsWhat's tiny and super portable and it will even hook onto your backpack with the built-in carabiner? JBL Clip 5 that's been discounted by 38%, that's what. Despite its size, the speaker can get fairly loud, no matter what music you're playing. While we didn't test this exact model, we did review the previous version, the JBL Clip 4, which we found delivers great sound and has a fully waterproof design. We'd call this deal a lock! Woot Presidents' Day Earbud DealsYou know what feels great? Saving $100 on a pair of Google Pixel Buds Pro. In our review, we noted these buds deliver great audio with powerful bass and we particularly enjoyed the hands-free Google Assistant access and translation features on Android. When it comes to noise cancelation, we found the Pixel Buds Pro deliver a great experience for buds at the $200 price range, so you'll love them even more now that they're nearly half-off. If you're looking for something a bit more affordable, the JBL Endurance Peak 3 is now an amazing 60% (that's marked down to less than $40). We reviewed these earbuds and gave them an \"Excellent\" rating and felt they were also worthy of our Editors' Choice award. They deliver powerful sound with plenty of bass, they have strong battery life, and they're fully waterproof\u2014what more could you want? \"JBL's Endurance Peak 3 earphones are a fantastic option for fitness fanatics,\" noted our expert, Tim Gideon. So run, don't walk, to grab this deal! Woot Presidents' Day Apple Watch DealsSeeing the Apple Watch Series 7 on sale always makes us happy because this is a fantastic piece of tech. In our review, we gave it an \"Outstanding\" rating and our Editors' Choice award. \"The Series 7 is Apple's most attractive and durable wearable yet,\" noted our expert, Angela Moscaritolo. She also appreciated the large display, fast charging capabilities, and the fact that it will survive quite a few bumps and drops. Swapping out the band on your Apple Watch can be rather costly, but not if you choose one of the many Solo Loops available at Woot. These are not adjustable, so you're going to have to make sure you're picking the right size. Woot has them in a multitude of colors, including shades of red and pink or blues. You'll also be able to pick the size of your Apple Watch so you can ensure it won't just fit around your wrist, but also your device. Make sure to check out our guide on picking the right Apple Watch Solo Loop band size. Woot Presidents' Day Monitor DealsUpgrading your home office? Start with this amazing Samsung ViewFinity S5 which is down to one of the best prices we've seen this year. At 34 inches, this is a fairly large monitor with a 21:9 ratio and impeccable 1440p resolution. While it may not be a gaming monitor, its 100Hz refresh rate is going to perform well enough even when you're playing your favorites.

You don\u2019t have to be a genius to get in. With the right approach and a bit of determination, you could land a role at one of the most innovative companies on the planet. Let\u2019s break down what you need to know about getting a job at Google, from the application process to the types of roles available. Key Takeaways Google offers a wide range of roles from technical to creative, catering to diverse skill sets. The hiring process involves multiple stages, including applications and interviews. Technical roles at Google include software development, data science, and engineering. Marketing and creative positions cover digital marketing, content strategy, and brand management. Google provides flexible work options, including remote and flexible schedules. Understanding the Hiring Process at Google Application and Interview Stages Getting a job at Google can be quite the adventure. The process usually kicks off with an online application, where you\u2019ll need to submit your resume and any other required documents. Once your application is reviewed, you may be invited to a phone or video interview. This is often followed by one or more on-site interviews, which can be both technical and non-technical in nature. These stages are designed to assess not just your skills, but also how well you fit with Google\u2019s culture. Tips for a Successful Application Tailor your resume: Make sure your resume highlights relevant experiences and skills that align with the job description. Research Google\u2019s culture: Understand the company\u2019s values and work environment to better align your application.

Google typically updates candidates on their status within a few weeks. If you\u2019re selected for an interview, you\u2019ll receive details about the process and what to expect.

PCMag UK News The Best Last Minute Presidents' Day Deals at Woot: Save on Apple, JBL, Google, More You get to save up to 70% at Woot this holiday. Celebrate with some of the biggest tech brands with even bigger price cuts. PCMag UK Feb 17, 2025 (PCMag/Woot) Presidents' Day is nearly over, and it's still a fantastic time to pick up some incredible deals on your favorite tech at Woot. Now, we need to remind you that Woot's deals are a bit different than what we see elsewhere because these discounts only last until the stock runs out or the deal expires (whichever happens first). So, let's kick things off by checking out the best Presidents' Day we found at Woot. And don't forget to check out our round-up of the Best Presidents' Day Tech Deals. Woot Presidents' Day Speaker DealsWhat's tiny and super portable and it will even hook onto your backpack with the built-in carabiner? JBL Clip 5 that's been discounted by 38%, that's what. Despite its size, the speaker can get fairly loud, no matter what music you're playing. While we didn't test this exact model, we did review the previous version, the JBL Clip 4, which we found delivers great sound and has a fully waterproof design. We'd call this deal a lock! Woot Presidents' Day Earbud DealsYou know what feels great? Saving $100 on a pair of Google Pixel Buds Pro. In our review, we noted these buds deliver great audio with powerful bass and we particularly enjoyed the hands-free Google Assistant access and translation features on Android. When it comes to noise cancelation, we found the Pixel Buds Pro deliver a great experience for buds at the $200 price range, so you'll love them even more now that they're nearly half-off. If you're looking for something a bit more affordable, the JBL Endurance Peak 3 is now an amazing 60% (that's marked down to less than $40). We reviewed these earbuds and gave them an \"Excellent\" rating and felt they were also worthy of our Editors' Choice award. They deliver powerful sound with plenty of bass, they have strong battery life, and they're fully waterproof\u2014what more could you want? \"JBL's Endurance Peak 3 earphones are a fantastic option for fitness fanatics,\" noted our expert, Tim Gideon. So run, don't walk, to grab this deal! If you like your earbuds with a bit of AI, then the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 should be on your radar, especially now that they're 33% off. Our expert, Christian de Looper noted these buds are more comfortable and easier to control than older Samsung models and the noise cancellation is surprisingly good. In our review, he also mentions the battery life is not great at all, but if you don't mind charging them often, you're good to go. If you have a Samsung phone, Galaxy AI will translate conversations for you on the go, which is pretty handy if you travel often. Woot Presidents' Day Headphones DealsIf you'd rather get over the ear headphones, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 offer a stylish design, a comfortable build, and 60 hours of battery life. In our review we rated these as \"Excellent\" for their great audio performance and robust bass. They \"deliver a wonderful audio experience and high-quality active noise cancellation at a fittingly high price,\" says our expert Tim Gideon. Well, that high price is now low, low, low with a $210 price cut. Woot Presidents' Day Apple Watch DealsSeeing the Apple Watch Series 7 on sale always makes us happy because this is a fantastic piece of tech. In our review, we gave it an \"Outstanding\" rating and our Editors' Choice award. \"The Series 7 is Apple's most attractive and durable wearable yet,\" noted our expert, Angela Moscaritolo. She also appreciated the large display, fast charging capabilities, and the fact that it will survive quite ",

Google today sent a \u201cFebruary Newsletter\u201d to Gemini Advanced subscribers, with Google AI Premium being $19. 99 per month. It starts by recapping the recent Experimental model launches, and differentiates them as such: Gemini 2. 0 Pro Experimental: \u201cOur leading model designed for this new era of AI, providing better factuality and exceptional performance for coding and math prompts. 2. 0 Pro Experimental will help you navigate the most complex tasks with greater ease and accuracy. \u201d Gemini 2. 0 Flash Thinking: \u201cBuilt on the speed and performance of 2. 0 Flash, this experimental model transparently showcases its thought process in real time. Expand to see why it responded a certain way, its assumptions, and trace the reasoning. \u201d It also highlights last week\u2019s launch of recall in the Gemini app and NotebookLM Premium. New in this Gemini Advanced email is a tease about \u201cMore exciting updates are on the horizon,\u201d specifically \u201cin the coming months. \u201d The subscription is referred to as \u201cyour pass to Google\u2019s next-gen AI,\u201d so these bullet points might be referring to more than just the Gemini app. \u201cExplore new ways to create with leading video, image, and audio generation tools. \u201d The Gemini app already provides access to Imagen 3, which last updated in January, while Veo 2 is behind a Google Labs waitlist. Audio generation is presumably referring to MusicLM and/or Lyria. It would be interesting if Gemini Advanced provided priority access to those standalone or Gemini-integrated tools. \u201cBe more productive with agentic tools that can take action on your behalf, freeing you up to spend your time how you want. \u201d In terms of agentic tools there\u2019s Project Mariner, which CEO Sundar Pichai previously said would come to the Gemini app in some form this year. Other agentic features could be in Google Workspace, with I/O 2024 featuring a demo about how you could \u201cask Gemini to automatically organize email attachments in Drive, generate a sheet with the data and then analyze it with Data Q&A. \u201d \u201cTackle even more complex projects with new model upgrades and access to experimental models built to deliver improved performance. \u201d The last point is more straightforward with Gemini 2. 0 Pro eventually hitting stable and becoming the default model for Advanced subscribers. It will be interesting to see how Gemini 2. 0 Flash Thinking gets presented to end users. Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Expanded caption history First up is a significant change to how live captions work. At present, Google says, captions display in real time but go away once they're \"no longer relevant to the current conversation. \" With this change, you'll be able to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of live captions.

PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro ZDNETFocusing on the most important information in your work call is about to get a little easier. Google is rolling out a pair of new features for Meet today -- one that will help you catch up on missed information and one that will help you plan for what to do after the meeting. Expanded caption history First up is a significant change to how live captions work. At present, Google says, captions display in real time but go away once they're \"no longer relevant to the current conversation. \" With this change, you'll be able to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of live captions. There's a \"Jump to the bottom\" button to go back to what's happening currently. This is especially useful if you're late to the meeting and want to catch up or want to reference specific details from earlier in the meeting. Also: How to use Gemini's Deep Research to browse the web faster and better AI-generated 'Next Steps' GoogleAlso new is a \"Next Steps\" feature, an expansion of the \"Take Notes for me\" feature that rolled out last fall.",

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support \u2014 from launch \u2014 of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer\u2019s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won\u2019t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it\u2019s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup \u2014 from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee \u2013 that includes returns during that period \u2013 customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a \u201cused\u201d smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms \u2013 so it isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cbetter\u201d in every instance. If you\u2019re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon\u2019s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google\u2019s own \u201cCertified Refurbished Pixel Phones\u201d program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 \u2013 giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It\u2019s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support \u2014 from launch \u2014 of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer\u2019s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won\u2019t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it\u2019s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup \u2014 from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee \u2013 that includes returns during that period \u2013 customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a \u201cused\u201d smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms \u2013 so it isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cbetter\u201d in every instance. If you\u2019re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon\u2019s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google\u2019s own \u201cCertified Refurbished Pixel Phones\u201d program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 \u2013 giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices.
