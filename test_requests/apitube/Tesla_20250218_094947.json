The tycoon has earned the moniker “President Musk” from those who see his actions as an overreach. The House of Representatives panel working with DOGE recently sent a letter to the heads of both NPR and PBS demanding that they appear to testify on Capitol Hill regarding taking government funding to share what the panel referred to as “systemically biased content. ” That hearing has not yet taken place.

By CNN Newsource Published February 17, 2025 8:05 AM By Lisa Respers France, CNN (CNN) — If it makes Sheryl Crow, happy it can’t be that bad, right? The singer recently dumped her Tesla in protest of the company’s owner, Elon Musk. She posted a video that showed her waving goodbye to the electric vehicle as it was driven away on a flatbed. In the caption Crow wrote, “My parents always said… you are who you hang out with. ” “There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with,” she wrote. “So long Tesla. ” Crow added that she was donating the money to National Public Radio (NPR), which she wrote “is under threat by President Musk, in hopes that the truth will continue to find its way to those willing to know the truth. ” Musk, who is the richest man in the world, has faced criticism after President Donald Trump announced in November that Musk was being put in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), formed to look for what the administration has said is fraud and waste in the government. The tycoon has earned the moniker “President Musk” from those who see his actions as an overreach. The House of Representatives panel working with DOGE recently sent a letter to the heads of both NPR and PBS demanding that they appear to testify on Capitol Hill regarding taking government funding to share what the panel referred to as “systemically biased content. ” That hearing has not yet taken place.

Photo by: InsideEVs Kevin Williams By: Kevin Williams Feb 17, at 11:00am ET Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Share Comment Country-pop singer Sheryl Crow sold her Tesla Model 3 and donated the proceeds to NPR. Simultaneously, protests have been occurring nationwide at Tesla stores. Tesla's sales have been on a downtrend, especially in Europe. It’s time to acknowledge the elephant in the room here: Elon Musk’s meddling in global politics, far-right activism and wanton slash-and-burn of U. S government departments and programs via the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are increasingly inseparable from the average person’s perception of Tesla. For a while, folks were content to turn a blind eye, put up half-hearted “Bought this before I knew he was crazy” bumper stickers, or somehow simply not know what was going on. We are past that now. The backlash against Tesla because of Musk’s antics in government is gaining steam. Protests against the automaker at its various stores around the U. S. and worldwide broke out this weekend, including with some high-profile celebrities using the opportunity to publicly move on from Musk’s cars. Country-pop musician Sheryl Crow announced that she sold her Tesla Model 3, and is donating the vehicle’s proceeds to NPR. This comes hot on the heels of Musk’s decree on X that the government should “Defund NPR. ” Although most of NPR’s funding does not actually come from the federal government, NPR said a great deal of the earmarked funds from the federal government are important to local stations remaining on air.

The singer took Instagram reels, posting a short video of her waving goodbye to her Model 3 being hauled away via a flatbed while the song “Time to Say Goodbye” by Andrea Bocelli plays. In the caption, crow says “My parents said… you are who you hang out with. There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long, Tesla. ” As per usual in today’s social media-driven world, the comments on the post are polarized. While some praise the singer’s stand against Musk, others criticize her for what they see as DOGE and Musk simply exposing government waste. Crow has parried most of those comments fairly effectively, though. True, maybe Sheryl Crow might no longer not be a big A-list star on the same level as Beyoncé or Taylor Swift, but her very public display of boycotting Elon Musk and Tesla is something that will serve to alarm regular people. Some may uncharitably call this “virtue signaling,” but I think this is just another example of growing anti-tesla sentiment among the Average Joe who might not know much about EVs or politics. And Crow wasn’t alone in expressing her distaste for Musk over the weekend. In perhaps the first tangible real-world impact from the nascent social media platform Bluesky, protests against Musk and DOGE were held at Tesla stores across the U. S. this weekend. According to news reports and social media posts, hundreds of people turned out to various Tesla locations to express their displeasure with what’s going on: Some owners have reported their Teslas getting vandalized with anti-Musk graffiti. We aren’t a pop culture publication, but It’s easy to forget that lots of average people don’t really know much about EVs, Musk or the way he operates his companies. That changed on Jan 20. Now that Musk has ingratiated himself into the Trump administration and has turned the government upside down on so many levels, it won’t be uncommon for the average person to have a newfound opinion on Musk and in turn, Tesla. Musk seems to be able to do no wrong in the new administration’s eyes, and for many people, the only way they can push back with any sort of safety or effectiveness is to sell and boycott Tesla products.

Photo by: InsideEVs Kevin Williams By: Kevin Williams Feb 17, at 11:00am ET Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Share Comment Country-pop singer Sheryl Crow sold her Tesla Model 3 and donated the proceeds to NPR. Simultaneously, protests have been occurring nationwide at Tesla stores. Tesla's sales have been on a downtrend, especially in Europe. It’s time to acknowledge the elephant in the room here: Elon Musk’s meddling in global politics, far-right activism and wanton slash-and-burn of U. S government departments and programs via the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are increasingly inseparable from the average person’s perception of Tesla. For a while, folks were content to turn a blind eye, put up half-hearted “Bought this before I knew he was crazy” bumper stickers, or somehow simply not know what was going on. We are past that now. The backlash against Tesla because of Musk’s antics in government is gaining steam. Protests against the automaker at its various stores around the U. S. and worldwide broke out this weekend, including with some high-profile celebrities using the opportunity to publicly move on from Musk’s cars. Country-pop musician Sheryl Crow announced that she sold her Tesla Model 3, and is donating the vehicle’s proceeds to NPR. This comes hot on the heels of Musk’s decree on X that the government should “Defund NPR. ” Although most of NPR’s funding does not actually come from the federal government, NPR said a great deal of the earmarked funds from the federal government are important to local stations remaining on air.

The singer took Instagram reels, posting a short video of her waving goodbye to her Model 3 being hauled away via a flatbed while the song “Time to Say Goodbye” by Andrea Bocelli plays. In the caption, crow says “My parents said… you are who you hang out with. There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long, Tesla. ” As per usual in today’s social media-driven world, the comments on the post are polarized. While some praise the singer’s stand against Musk, others criticize her for what they see as DOGE and Musk simply exposing government waste. Crow has parried most of those comments fairly effectively, though. True, maybe Sheryl Crow might no longer not be a big A-list star on the same level as Beyoncé or Taylor Swift, but her very public display of boycotting Elon Musk and Tesla is something that will serve to alarm regular people. Some may uncharitably call this “virtue signaling,” but I think this is just another example of growing anti-tesla sentiment among the Average Joe who might not know much about EVs or politics. And Crow wasn’t alone in expressing her distaste for Musk over the weekend. In perhaps the first tangible real-world impact from the nascent social media platform Bluesky, protests against Musk and DOGE were held at Tesla stores across the U. S. this weekend. According to news reports and social media posts, hundreds of people turned out to various Tesla locations to express their displeasure with what’s going on: Some owners have reported their Teslas getting vandalized with anti-Musk graffiti. We aren’t a pop culture publication, but It’s easy to forget that lots of average people don’t really know much about EVs, Musk or the way he operates his companies. That changed on Jan 20. Now that Musk has ingratiated himself into the Trump administration and has turned the government upside down on so many levels, it won’t be uncommon for the average person to have a newfound opinion on Musk and in turn, Tesla. Musk seems to be able to do no wrong in the new administration’s eyes, and for many people, the only way they can push back with any sort of safety or effectiveness is to sell and boycott Tesla products.

With sales crashing and the board selling, it looks like some insiders are finally waking up. As we reported last week, a grassroots movement has sprung to organize protests against Elon Musk at Tesla stores around North America. The protests appear to have been quite successful, with primarily peaceful demonstrations in front of Tesla stores. Here’s an example in front of Tesla’s Minneapolis store: Happening now: Protesters at the Tesla service center just outside of Minneapolis. Signs reading “Unplug Mad King Musk”, “This car runs on facsism”, “Who buys cars from a nazi?”, “Say no to doge”, “Don’t buy swasticars, BAD DOGE!”. — daviss (@daviss. bsky. social) 2025-02-15T17:34:06. 172Z Similar protests happened at dozens of Tesla stores for hours in an attempt to disrupt sales and protest Musk’s meddling in politics. Tesla’s Manhattan showroom saw one of the biggest protests: Protestors outside the Tesla Manhattan Showroom. \"Don't buy swastikars\" (📹 @sandibachom. bsky. social ) #3E #EndOligarchy #TeslaTakeover #TeslaProtests— Anonymous (@youranoncentral. bsky. social) 2025-02-15T18:12:20. 490Z While most protests were peaceful and lawful, some vandalism did happen, with images of Tesla stores getting graffitied with anti-fascism phrases. Groups supporting the protests, like Anonymous, say it is just the beginning and plan to keep putting pressure on Tesla to, in turn, put pressure on Musk. As we previously reported, Tesla’s sales this year are crashing in Europe, where they release monthly data. In the US, the data comes a bit later, and therefore, it’s hard to tell how much Tesla sales are being affected by the negative perception of its CEO, but these protests against Tesla are undoubtedly unprecedented. We have often highlighted how Tesla’s board of directors, which has authority over the CEO, has been entirely silent on this situation – letting Musk do whatever he wants, including spending little time at Tesla while running X, xAI, SpaceX, Neuralink, Boring Company, and DOGE. While the board remains silent, it sounds like there’s finally some pushback amongst Tesla insiders. The Washington Post has obtained a recording from a recent staff meeting at Tesla where some have openly expressed concerns about Musk: Employees and senior managers at a recent staff meeting at one Tesla division openly expressed concern that Musk is damaging the company’s business and sustainability mission, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post. Tesla employees spoke to the Post about rising beliefs amongst the ranks about Musk “tarnishing the brand. ” According to a Tesla employee speaking to the Post, senior managers said that they believe “the company would be better off if Musk resigned. ” While some insiders are starting to speak out within the company, the report highlights how most discontent with Musk among employees happens in private: Inside Tesla, most discussion of discomfort with the CEO happens quietly over lunch or in private messages, one of the employees who spoke with The Post said, and workers use external communication tools, fearing the company could be monitoring staff for signs of disloyalty. Tesla regularly implements waves of layoffs, and lately, Musk has been using them to consolidate power and keep only loyalists among his top ranks at Tesla. Electrek’s Take Is this momentum against Elon at Tesla? It’s hard to tell. I have been fearing that Elon drove away most people who could stand against him at Tesla. The protests are good, and employees speaking up is good, but at the end of the day, with the board in Elon’s pocket, it means that nothing short of the stock price crashing to push shareholders to kick the board out is needed. I could see that happening, as I expect this quarter’s deliveries and earnings to be quite bad. However, there could also be a broader market downturn, on which Musk could blame Tesla’s stock’s poor performance. It should be interesting next few months. Add Electrek to your Google News feed.

Nicht umsonst ist das Tesla Model Y das meistverkaufte E-Modell der Welt. Autos wie der Xpeng G6 wollen dem Weltmeister ans Leder 18. 02. 2025 , 00:05 Uhr 7 Bilder Der Nächste, bitte: Wie der Xpeng G6 gegen Tesla Y antritt 7 Bilder Von Thomas Geiger, dpa Es vergeht zwar kaum ein Quartal, in dem nicht wieder eine neue China-Marke nach Westen drängt und sich dafür eine andere in die Insolvenz verabschiedet. Doch immer mal wieder sind unter den Debütanten Marken, die aufhorchen lassen - wie zuletzt Xpeng. Zum einen, weil sich der VW-Konzern milliardenschwer an dem Start-up beteiligt und es so aus der Vielzahl der anonymen Newcomer heraus gehoben hat. Und zum anderen, weil die Autos aus dem Südosten des Landes aus dem Stand heraus so gut gelungen sind, dass sie sich mit Tesla \u0026 Co messen können. Das gilt insbesondere für den Xpeng G6, der den elektrischen Weltmeister Modell Y ins Visier nimmt. Neben der Luxuslimousine P7 und dem XL-Geländewagen G9 steht der bei uns seit Herbst ab 43. 600 Euro im Handel. Die gleichen Proportionen zum kleineren Preis Weil es das Tesla Model Y nach der Überarbeitung zum Jahreswechsel aktuell nur in der Launch-Series für 60. 990 Euro aufwärts gibt, bieten die Chinesen damit aktuell einen gravierenden Preisvorteil. Aber selbst wenn die Amerikaner peu à peu die einfacheren Versionen nachreichen, wird Tesla an der Kasse wohl - so war es zumindest vor der Modellpflege - den Kürzeren ziehen. Und das für ein Auto, das mit 4,75 Länge und 2,89 Metern Radstand nicht nur ein vergleichbares Format hat. Sondern der G6 ist dem Weltmeister mit seinem aalglatten und schnörkellosem Design, dem Kuppeldach und dem kurzen Heck auch wie aus dem Gesicht geschnitten. Auch das Ambiente wirkt vertraut Dabei erinnert nicht nur der Aufbau an Tesla, sondern auch das Ambiente: Hier wie dort gibt es deshalb ein betont cleanes und kühles Cockpit mit wenigen Schaltern und Hebeln und nichts, was dem Blick oder gar den Händen Halt bietet. Allerdings geht Xpeng nicht ganz so weit wie Tesla und spendiert dem G6 deshalb zum Beispiel neben dem riesigen Bildschirm vor der Mittelkonsole noch ein zweites, kleineres Display hinter dem Lenkrad. Weil darauf alle wichtigen Informationen eingeblendet werden, bleibt der Blick so stets auf der Straße. Außerdem ist der Xpeng deutlich wohnlicher. Das liegt zum einen an den verwendeten Materialien und zum anderen an der Möblierung. Nicht umsonst lassen sich die Vordersitze so weit flachlegen, dass man beim Laden hinten sitzen und buchstäblich die Beine hochlegen kann. Keine Ruhe bei der Ladepause Nur, dass man dazu selten Gelegenheit bekommt. Denn beim Laden spielt der Chinese seine größten Vorzüge aus. Weil er mit einem 800-Volt-System arbeitet, kann schon das Grundmodell mit bis zu 215 und die Top-Version sogar mit maximal 280 kW laden. Kein Wunder, dass der Hub von 20 auf 80 Prozent in bestenfalls 15 Minuten gelingt. Da wechselt man beim Ladestopp besser von Cappuccino auf Espresso - oder trinkt seinen Kaffee - noch oder schon wieder - daheim. Denn dort ist der G6 von der gemütlichen Sorte und zieht die Energie nur mit maximal 11 kW aus der Wallbox. Gespeichert wird beim Basismodell in einem Akku mit 66 kWh für 435 Kilometer, ansonsten baut Xpeng 87,5 kWh ein, die für bis zu 570 Kilometer reichen. Beide Akkus können auch mit externen Geräten angezapft werden. Der G6 ist flott, fremdelt aber mit dem Fahrer So weit zu fahren, ist im Xpeng keine Strafe. Im Gegenteil: Denn erstens ist der Xpeng üppig motorisiert. So fährt schon das Basismodell (RWD Standard) mit einem Heckmotor von 190 kW/258 PS und 440 Nm. Beim RWD Long Range verfügt schon der Heckmotor 210 kW/286 PS und im Top-Modell sind zwei Motoren mit zusammen 350 kW/476 PS installiert. Zweitens bietet er mit Sprintwerten (0 auf Tempo 100) zwischen 6,9 bis 4,1 Sekunden, und bis zu 200 km/h Spitze attraktive Fahrleistungen. Und drittens ist er komfortabel und wie so viele Elektroautos sehr entspannt abgestimmt: Die Lenkung ist soft aber präzise, das Luftfederfahrwerk bügelt gefühlt die Unebenheiten glatt.

By IBT News Desk February 18, 2025 11:08 IST Tesla ramps up hiring in India after Elon Musk-PM Modi meet in USIANS After the successful visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the US, Elon Musk-run Tesla has ramped up hiring in India, a market where it is slated to enter anytime soon. The hiring by Tesla in India comes as Musk met PM Modi in Washington, DC, last week and discussed various issues, including space, mobility, technology and innovation. On its LinkedIn page, the electric car-maker has posted hiring alerts for at least 13 roles — mostly in Mumbai and Delhi. The jobs include business operation analyst, service technician and various advisory roles, including customer engagement manager and order operations specialist, as per its LinkedIn advertisements. The hiring comes at a time when India has now reduced basic customs duty on high-end cars priced above $40,000 from 110 per cent to 70 per cent. Musk has toyed with the idea of developing a more affordable version of Tesla for the India market but there has not been much movement on it yet. After meeting PM Modi, Musk said it was an \"honour to meet\" him. Tesla and SpaceX CEO called on PM Modi at the Blair House in Washington, DCIANS \"It was a delight to meet Elon Musk's family and to talk about a wide range of subjects,\" PM Modi earlier posted on X. \"We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology, and innovation. I talked about India's efforts towards reform and furthering 'Minimum Government, Maximum Governance\". The Tesla and SpaceX CEO called on PM Modi at the Blair House in Washington, DC. \"PM Modi and Musk discussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and US entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development. Their discussion also touched on opportunities to deepen cooperation in emerging technologies, entrepreneurship, and good governance,\" according to a statement from the MEA. During the meeting, the PM also presented books to Elon Musk's three children. He gifted them The Crescent Moon by Rabindranath Tagore, The Great RK Narayan Collection, and Panchatantra by Pandit Vishnu Sharma. He later also shared photos that show the children reading the books. Meanwhile, Musk also presented PM Modi with a gift. It is speculated to be a heat shield tile that flew on SpaceX's Starship flight test 5 which took place in October last year.

By IBT News Desk February 18, 2025 11:08 IST Tesla ramps up hiring in India after Elon Musk-PM Modi meet in USIANS After the successful visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the US, Elon Musk-run Tesla has ramped up hiring in India, a market where it is slated to enter anytime soon. The hiring by Tesla in India comes as Musk met PM Modi in Washington, DC, last week and discussed various issues, including space, mobility, technology and innovation. On its LinkedIn page, the electric car-maker has posted hiring alerts for at least 13 roles — mostly in Mumbai and Delhi. The jobs include business operation analyst, service technician and various advisory roles, including customer engagement manager and order operations specialist, as per its LinkedIn advertisements. The hiring comes at a time when India has now reduced basic customs duty on high-end cars priced above $40,000 from 110 per cent to 70 per cent. Musk has toyed with the idea of developing a more affordable version of Tesla for the India market but there has not been much movement on it yet. After meeting PM Modi, Musk said it was an \"honour to meet\" him. Tesla and SpaceX CEO called on PM Modi at the Blair House in Washington, DCIANS \"It was a delight to meet Elon Musk's family and to talk about a wide range of subjects,\" PM Modi earlier posted on X. \"We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology, and innovation. I talked about India's efforts towards reform and furthering 'Minimum Government, Maximum Governance\". The Tesla and SpaceX CEO called on PM Modi at the Blair House in Washington, DC. \"PM Modi and Musk discussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and US entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development. Their discussion also touched on opportunities to deepen cooperation in emerging technologies, entrepreneurship, and good governance,\" according to a statement from the MEA. During the meeting, the PM also presented books to Elon Musk's three children. He gifted them The Crescent Moon by Rabindranath Tagore, The Great RK Narayan Collection, and Panchatantra by Pandit Vishnu Sharma. He later also shared photos that show the children reading the books. Meanwhile, Musk also presented PM Modi with a gift. It is speculated to be a heat shield tile that flew on SpaceX's Starship flight test 5 which took place in October last year.

PM Modi US Visit: In a major development signaling its potential entry into the Indian market, Tesla (TSLA) has begun hiring in India, as per recent LinkedIn job listings. Neha Kumari 18 Feb 2025 11:57 IST Follow Us New Update Photograph: (IANS) In a major development signaling its potential entry into the Indian market, Tesla (TSLA) has begun hiring in India, as per recent LinkedIn job listings. The move comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the United States last week. Hiring Begins in Mumbai Tesla has listed 13 job openings in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India's financial capital. The positions range across key operational roles, including: Sales advisors Operations managers Technicians Customer support executives While Tesla’s hiring activity hints at a potential launch, it remains unclear if Musk and Modi’s discussions during their Washington meeting directly influenced the move. Tesla’s Plans for India Reports suggest that Tesla had been considering opening a showroom in New Delhi as early as December 2023. However, Musk had cancelled his India visit in April 2024 and also scrapped plans to invest billions in an Indian manufacturing plant, citing concerns over import duties and regulatory challenges. Tesla's entry into India’s EV market could face hurdles due to the country's steep automobile import duties, which go as high as 100%. However, recent diplomatic shifts may change this, as PM Modi’s engagement with the Donald Trump administration aims to lower import tariffs on American goods, including electric vehicles. Why India Now? Tesla is seeking new markets as it battles declining sales in Europe, North America, and China due to: Intensified competition from EV rivals Weakened automobile demand globally Brand concerns linked to Musk’s public image A Strategic Move for Tesla and India India is seen as a fast-growing EV market, making it an attractive destination for Tesla's global expansion plans. If Tesla successfully establishes its footprint, it could be a game-changer for the Indian EV sector, boosting local employment, technological advancements, and sustainable mobility. With Tesla now actively hiring, the big question remains: Is India finally getting its first Tesla showroom and sales operations? Advertisment Keep abreast with all the Latest News Updates.

Advertisment AUTO BUSINESS Another Feather in the Cap in PM Modi's US Visit! Elon Musk's Tesla Starts Hiring in India, Opening on Cards? PM Modi US Visit: In a major development signaling its potential entry into the Indian market, Tesla (TSLA) has begun hiring in India, as per recent LinkedIn job listings. Neha Kumari 18 Feb 2025 11:57 IST Follow Us New Update Photograph: (IANS) In a major development signaling its potential entry into the Indian market, Tesla (TSLA) has begun hiring in India, as per recent LinkedIn job listings. The move comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the United States last week. Hiring Begins in Mumbai Tesla has listed 13 job openings in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India's financial capital. The positions range across key operational roles, including: Sales advisors Operations managers Technicians Customer support executives While Tesla’s hiring activity hints at a potential launch, it remains unclear if Musk and Modi’s discussions during their Washington meeting directly influenced the move. Tesla’s Plans for India Reports suggest that Tesla had been considering opening a showroom in New Delhi as early as December 2023. However, Musk had cancelled his India visit in April 2024 and also scrapped plans to invest billions in an Indian manufacturing plant, citing concerns over import duties and regulatory challenges. Tesla's entry into India’s EV market could face hurdles due to the country's steep automobile import duties, which go as high as 100%. However, recent diplomatic shifts may change this, as PM Modi’s engagement with the Donald Trump administration aims to lower import tariffs on American goods, including electric vehicles. Why India Now? Tesla is seeking new markets as it battles declining sales in Europe, North America, and China due to: Intensified competition from EV rivals Weakened automobile demand globally Brand concerns linked to Musk’s public image A Strategic Move for Tesla and India India is seen as a fast-growing EV market, making it an attractive destination for Tesla's global expansion plans. If Tesla successfully establishes its footprint, it could be a game-changer for the Indian EV sector, boosting local employment, technological advancements, and sustainable mobility. With Tesla now actively hiring, the big question remains: Is India finally getting its first Tesla showroom and sales operations? Advertisment Keep abreast with all the Latest News Updates.

Tesla begins hiring in India after Musk and Modi meet Tuesday, February 18, 2025 at 9:44 AM by AFP 2 min read While India's electric car market is small, it still represents a growth opportunity for Tesla which is battling increased Chinese competition. Photo: JOSH EDELSON / AFP/FileSource: AFPCHECK OUT: Don't let unemployment hold you back. Start your digital marketing journey today. Electric vehicle maker Tesla has begun hiring in India, with the company of tycoon Elon Musk issuing advertisements days after US President Donald Trump's right-hand man met with India's premier. Tesla has more than a dozen job listings on its website, for both the capital New Delhi and economic hub Mumbai, including for a store manager and service technicians. The job listings were posted on the employment website LinkedIn on Monday. Tesla's India push comes after Musk met one-on-one with Prime Minister Narenda Modi in Washington, raising questions over whether the world's richest man was meeting the Indian leader in an official or business capacity. Musk has been seeking business opportunities in the world's most populous nation, with media reports last year suggesting it was scouting for factory and showroom locations. Musk has also sought to open his satellite internet service Starlink in India, with communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in November saying the company would be allowed to operate if it complies with \"security\" regulations.

The potential launch of Starlink -- with its network of low Earth orbit satellites capable of providing internet to remote and disconnected locations -- in the world's most populous country has been accompanied by fierce policy debates and alleged national security concerns. Musk was due to visit India in 2024, following suggestions that he would announce major investment plans, but later cancelled the trip due to what he said were \"very heavy Tesla obligations\". While India's electric car market is small, it still represents a growth opportunity for Tesla which is battling increased Chinese competition and its first slump in annual EV sales. India has long had steep import taxes for electric vehicles -- Musk once complained they were among the \"highest in the world\" -- which had prevented Tesla from making inroads in the absence of local manufacturing. But India last year cut import taxes on electric vehicles for global automakers that committed to invest $500 million and start local production within three years.

Digital Journal WORLD TECH \u0026 SCIENCE SOCIAL MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE SPORTS Business Tesla begins hiring in India after Musk and Modi meet ByAFP Published February 18, 2025 While India's electric car market is small, it still represents a growth opportunity for Tesla which is battling increased Chinese competition - Copyright AFP/File JOSH EDELSON While India's electric car market is small, it still represents a growth opportunity for Tesla which is battling increased Chinese competition - Copyright AFP/File JOSH EDELSONElectric vehicle maker Tesla has begun hiring in India, with the company of tycoon Elon Musk issuing advertisements days after US President Donald Trump’s right-hand man met with India’s premier. Tesla has more than a dozen job listings on its website, for both the capital New Delhi and economic hub Mumbai, including for a store manager and service technicians. The job listings were posted on the employment website LinkedIn on Monday. Tesla’s India push comes after Musk met one-on-one with Prime Minister Narenda Modi in Washington, raising questions over whether the world’s richest man was meeting the Indian leader in an official or business capacity. Musk has been seeking business opportunities in the world’s most populous nation, with media reports last year suggesting it was scouting for factory and showroom locations. Musk has also sought to open his satellite internet service Starlink in India, with communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in November saying the company would be allowed to operate if it complies with “security” regulations. The potential launch of Starlink — with its network of low Earth orbit satellites capable of providing internet to remote and disconnected locations — in the world’s most populous country has been accompanied by fierce policy debates and alleged national security concerns. Musk was due to visit India in 2024, following suggestions that he would announce major investment plans, but later cancelled the trip due to what he said were “very heavy Tesla obligations”. While India’s electric car market is small, it still represents a growth opportunity for Tesla which is battling increased Chinese competition and its first slump in annual EV sales. India has long had steep import taxes for electric vehicles — Musk once complained they were among the “highest in the world” — which had prevented Tesla from making inroads in the absence of local manufacturing. But India last year cut import taxes on electric vehicles for global automakers that committed to invest $500 million and start local production within three years. New Delhi had had offered quick tariff concessions ahead of Modi’s Washington visit, including slashing duties on high-end motorcycles — a boost to Harley-Davidson, the iconic US manufacturer whose struggles in India have irked Trump. India has also already accepted three US military flights carrying more than 300 migrants as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Tesla has more than a dozen job listings on its website, for both the capital New Delhi and economic hub Mumbai, including for a store manager and service technicians. The job listings were posted on the employment website LinkedIn on Monday. Tesla’s India push comes after Musk met one-on-one with Prime Minister Narenda Modi in Washington, raising questions over whether the world’s richest man was meeting the Indian leader in an official or business capacity. Musk has been seeking business opportunities in the world’s most populous nation, with media reports last year suggesting it was scouting for factory and showroom locations. Musk has also sought to open his satellite internet service Starlink in India, with communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in November saying the company would be allowed to operate if it complies with “security” regulations. The potential launch of Starlink — with its network of low Earth orbit satellites capable of providing internet to remote and disconnected locations — in the world’s most populous country has been accompanied by fierce policy debates and alleged national security concerns. Musk was due to visit India in 2024, following suggestions that he would announce major investment plans, but later cancelled the trip due to what he said were “very heavy Tesla obligations”. While India’s electric car market is small, it still represents a growth opportunity for Tesla which is battling increased Chinese competition and its first slump in annual EV sales. India has long had steep import taxes for electric vehicles — Musk once complained they were among the “highest in the world” — which had prevented Tesla from making inroads in the absence of local manufacturing. But India last year cut import taxes on electric vehicles for global automakers that committed to invest $500 million and start local production within three years. New Delhi had had offered quick tariff concessions ahead of Modi’s Washington visit, including slashing duties on high-end motorcycles — a boost to Harley-Davidson, the iconic US manufacturer whose struggles in India have irked Trump. India has also already accepted three US military flights carrying more than 300 migrants as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Financial Times sources in China hinted that Tesla FSD’s license approval might be used as a bargaining chip after U. S. President Trump implemented a 10% additional tariff on imported Chinese goods. China seeks to negotiate with President Trump. Tesla FSD’s rollout in Mexico is a bigger deal than it seems Tesla FSD was initially expected to roll out in China and Europe by the first quarter of 2025. However, the timeline for releasing Full Self-Driving in China might be pushed back, considering the situation between the U. S. and China. During Tesla’s full-year and Q4 2024 earnings call, Elon Musk talked about a few challenges the company faces in China with regard to FSD. “Then China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they weren’t — they currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government won’t let us do training in China. So, we’re in a bit of a there. It’s like a quandary,” Musk commented. As for Europe, Musk predicted Tesla FSD might be approved by May 2025. The Tesla CEO noted that the company has to pass through many regulations before FSD receives approval in Europe.

of Spec Studios/YouTube By Simon Alvarez Posted on February 17, 2025 A recent study has determined that even a very high mileage Tesla Model S on its original battery can perform well as a legitimate road tripping machine. This was demonstrated in a recent test from Out of Spec Testing involving a 2019 Tesla Model S Standard Range. The vehicle: For its test, the Out of Spec team used a 2019 Tesla Model S Standard Range, which was still equipped with its original 75 kWh battery. At its time of release, the Model S Standard Range had an EPA range rating of 285 miles per charge. While the Model S Standard Range that was used in the test was only six years old, the all-electric sedan has racked up over 250,000 miles. This was one of the reasons why the vehicle was acquired for less than $10,000 with incentives and FSD. The test: Similar to its other range tests, the Out of Spec team opted to run the 250,000-mile Model S Standard Range from full charge to zero at 70 mph on the highway. The conditions of the test did not seem very ideal for an electric vehicle, especially one that has racked up a quarter of a million miles in six years. As per Out of Spec team member Ryan Kassel, 20 mph winds were abounding during the day, and temperatures ranged from the 40s to the 50s. My friends bought a 250,000mi Model S *Raven* for $9,000 and it included FSD!Videos coming on this insane deal and how well the car has held up@RyanKassel ran it in the range, charging, and 10% challenge tests yesterday ⚡️ pic. twitter. com/XDu23MzU7U— Kyle Conner (@itskyleconner) February 6, 2025 The results: Despite these subpar conditions, the 2019 Model S Standard Range was able to travel 203 miles at 70 mph before the Out of Spec team called the test. As per the Out of Spec team, the Model S Standard Range consumed 57. 8 kWh of its battery during the test. The Model S Standard Range actually proved very efficient, doing 3. 6 miles per kWh. This is pretty impressive and close to the new Model 3 Performance, which did 3. 8 miles per kWh during the team’s 70 mph range test. Tesla longevity: A recent study published in Nature has stated that Tesla’s vehicles lead the industry and mileage. As per the study, Tesla’s electric vehicles are expected to cover an average of 204,000 miles over their lifetime, surpassing all other brands regardless of powertrain. Electric vehicles in the study had an average estimated mileage of 124,000 miles. Tesla’s electric vehicles have an estimated lifespan of 20. 3 years based on the study’s calculations.

of Spec Studios/YouTube By Simon Alvarez Posted on February 17, 2025 A recent study has determined that even a very high mileage Tesla Model S on its original battery can perform well as a legitimate road tripping machine. This was demonstrated in a recent test from Out of Spec Testing involving a 2019 Tesla Model S Standard Range. The vehicle: For its test, the Out of Spec team used a 2019 Tesla Model S Standard Range, which was still equipped with its original 75 kWh battery. At its time of release, the Model S Standard Range had an EPA range rating of 285 miles per charge. While the Model S Standard Range that was used in the test was only six years old, the all-electric sedan has racked up over 250,000 miles. This was one of the reasons why the vehicle was acquired for less than $10,000 with incentives and FSD. The test: Similar to its other range tests, the Out of Spec team opted to run the 250,000-mile Model S Standard Range from full charge to zero at 70 mph on the highway. The conditions of the test did not seem very ideal for an electric vehicle, especially one that has racked up a quarter of a million miles in six years. As per Out of Spec team member Ryan Kassel, 20 mph winds were abounding during the day, and temperatures ranged from the 40s to the 50s. My friends bought a 250,000mi Model S *Raven* for $9,000 and it included FSD!Videos coming on this insane deal and how well the car has held up@RyanKassel ran it in the range, charging, and 10% challenge tests yesterday ⚡️ pic. twitter. com/XDu23MzU7U— Kyle Conner (@itskyleconner) February 6, 2025 The results: Despite these subpar conditions, the 2019 Model S Standard Range was able to travel 203 miles at 70 mph before the Out of Spec team called the test. As per the Out of Spec team, the Model S Standard Range consumed 57. 8 kWh of its battery during the test. The Model S Standard Range actually proved very efficient, doing 3. 6 miles per kWh. This is pretty impressive and close to the new Model 3 Performance, which did 3. 8 miles per kWh during the team’s 70 mph range test. Tesla longevity: A recent study published in Nature has stated that Tesla’s vehicles lead the industry and mileage. As per the study, Tesla’s electric vehicles are expected to cover an average of 204,000 miles over their lifetime, surpassing all other brands regardless of powertrain. Electric vehicles in the study had an average estimated mileage of 124,000 miles. Tesla’s electric vehicles have an estimated lifespan of 20. 3 years based on the study’s calculations.

Tesla Cybertruck owner ponders leaving MA with wife and kids over death threats, abuse Credit: NBC 10 Boston/YouTube By Simon Alvarez Posted on February 17, 2025 A Tesla Cybertruck owner from Massachusetts is considering moving with his wife and three children over the abuse and harassment he is experiencing due to his vehicle. The Tesla owner noted that reactions to his Cybertruck became extremely negative following CEO Elon Musk’s declaration of support for U. S. President Donald Trump. The Cybertruck: Tesla owner Dr. Kumait Jaroje wrapped his Cybertruck in gold to promote his medical spa business. With Elon Musk’s close ties to Trump and his administration, as well as his work with DOGE, the Tesla owner noted that his vehicle, as well as he himself, has become the target of much abuse. “The salute happened, Musk, during the inauguration of Trump, and that’s when everything went crazy,” the Tesla owner told NBC 10 Boston. The threats: Dr. Jaroje noted that at first, it was people pointing and giving him the thumbs down, then it escalated to people screaming out of their cars and giving him middle fingers. Some motorists have reportedly also cut off the Tesla owner’s Cybertruck. A “Nazis F**k Off” sticker had been placed on his Cybertruck earlier this month. Clients are reportedly canceling their appointments due to his support of Musk and his Tesla, and his social media has been saturated with abuse. The Tesla owner also received a voice message that stated, “Please do the world a favor and put a bullet right between your tiny brain. ”The Cybertruck owner also shared a threatening message he received, which noted, “Oh, you better watch out because somebody someday will cut you off, and a bad guy will have a gun. ” A potential move: Ironically, the Tesla owner is an immigrant from Syria, which he fled due to violence. But with the abuse being hurled at himself and his vehicle, Dr. Jaroje is now considering moving away from Massachusetts with his wife and three children. “I remember President Trump saying, ‘Fight, fight, fight,’ you know. Is it fair for me to just eradicate my roots from here and take my kids away?” The Tesla owner noted. The Tesla owner’s segment with NBC 10 Boston can be viewed below.

Merano Posted on February 17, 2025 Tesla nabbed a new institutional investor despite all the hate Elon Musk receives worldwide from people who disagree with his latest political moves. Attessa Capital LLC, an investment adviser firm, acquired a new stake in Tesla in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to a 13F filing with the United States Securities \u0026 Exchange Commission, Attessa Capital acquired 2,703 TSLA shares, valued at approximately $1,092,000. The investment company’s Tesla shares account for 0. 7% of its holdings. Tesla is the 19th largest holding for Attessa Capital. A few other institutional investors bought Tesla shares before the end of 2024. For instance, World Investment Advisors LLC raised its stake in TSLA during Q3 2024 by 1,248. 9%. Data gathered by MarketBeat revealed that Tesla has an average rating of “Hold” and a consensus target price of $326. 50 from Wall Street analysts. Trump expects to launch broader automobile tariffs in April Tesla has come far from the days when a simple comment from Elon Musk could tank the stock or raise it to new heights. Many Tesla customers and retail investors have vocally disagreed with Musk’s current political roles and opinions recently. Some reports suggest that Musk’s political influence would affect Tesla’s global sales. However, Elon Musk and Tesla sales might not be as linked as they were a few years ago.

SPACEX ELON MUSK The Boring Company Hyperloop Artificial Intelligence MARKETPLACE News New Tesla Model Y first impressions after demo drive Credit: @nabean42/X By Simon Alvarez Posted on February 17, 2025 A Tesla Cybertruck owner from Austin, Texas recently shared a number of insights following a demo drive of the new Model Y. Tesla recently started offering demo drives of the revamped all-electric crossover. Based on posters that have been shared on social media media, it appears that test drives of the new Model Y were offered in Austin and Dallas, Texas. New Model Y general observations: Tesla Cybertruck owner @VoyageATXBen shared some of his impressions of the new Model Y on social media platform X. As per the Tesla owner, the new Model Y’s suspension was incredible as the vehicle felt extremely solid when going over bumps or imperfections on the road. Regen reportedly felt quite stronger than the Model Y classic, and the brake pedal itself felt much more firm. Ride quality-wise, the new Model Y reportedly felt very similar to the reengineered Tesla Model 3, which received widespread acclaim for its upgraded suspension system. I drove the new Model Y today! Here are some initial impressions:The new suspension is LEGENDARY. Going over bumps feels super solid and no longer includes a reverb/rattle noise. To me, regen felt stronger than the previous vehicle, the vehicle now also gives you the ability… pic. twitter. com/CjpN6tqzxI— Ben (@VoyageATXBen) February 16, 2025 New Model Y cabin: The Cybertruck owner praised the new Model Y’s cabin, which he noted was so quiet, it felt like he was wearing noise-cancelling headphones. The materials on the cabin and seats are reportedly a step up from the Model Y classic. The buttons on the new Model Y’s steering wheel reportedly felt like physical buttons as well. That being said, the Tesla owner noted that the single turn stalk felt almost cheap, perhaps because it was extremely light. The Tesla owner also observed that rear visibility has not improved from the Model Y classic since the revamped vehicle still has a slim rear windshield. The new model Y AC has a swing mode! It basically swings the vent left and right…neat!More initial impressions to come. This thing ROCKS pic. twitter. com/Azg376H7OP— Ben (@VoyageATXBen) February 16, 2025 Interesting features: The Cybertruck owner also shared a number of interesting observations of the new Model Y’s features during his test drive. For one, the demo unit that Tesla was offering for test drives had adaptive headlights enabled. The new Model Y’s air conditioning system also had a swing mode that vents air left and right, which was pretty neat. Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

SPACEX ELON MUSK The Boring Company Hyperloop Artificial Intelligence MARKETPLACE News Tesla FSD release in China faces potential delay (Credit: Tesla Asia/X) By Maria Merano Posted on February 17, 2025 Tesla Full Self-Driving’s (FSD) release in China is facing a potential delay as tensions rise between the US and Chinese governments. Financial Times sources in China hinted that Tesla FSD’s license approval might be used as a bargaining chip after U. S. President Trump implemented a 10% additional tariff on imported Chinese goods. China seeks to negotiate with President Trump. Tesla FSD’s rollout in Mexico is a bigger deal than it seems Tesla FSD was initially expected to roll out in China and Europe by the first quarter of 2025. However, the timeline for releasing Full Self-Driving in China might be pushed back, considering the situation between the U. S. and China. During Tesla’s full-year and Q4 2024 earnings call, Elon Musk talked about a few challenges the company faces in China with regard to FSD. “Then China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they weren’t — they currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government won’t let us do training in China. So, we’re in a bit of a there. It’s like a quandary,” Musk commented. As for Europe, Musk predicted Tesla FSD might be approved by May 2025. The Tesla CEO noted that the company has to pass through many regulations before FSD receives approval in Europe.

Tesla Cybertruck owner ponders leaving MA with wife and kids over death threats, abuse Credit: NBC 10 Boston/YouTube By Simon Alvarez Posted on February 17, 2025 A Tesla Cybertruck owner from Massachusetts is considering moving with his wife and three children over the abuse and harassment he is experiencing due to his vehicle. The Tesla owner noted that reactions to his Cybertruck became extremely negative following CEO Elon Musk’s declaration of support for U. S. President Donald Trump. The Cybertruck: Tesla owner Dr. Kumait Jaroje wrapped his Cybertruck in gold to promote his medical spa business. With Elon Musk’s close ties to Trump and his administration, as well as his work with DOGE, the Tesla owner noted that his vehicle, as well as he himself, has become the target of much abuse. “The salute happened, Musk, during the inauguration of Trump, and that’s when everything went crazy,” the Tesla owner told NBC 10 Boston. The threats: Dr. Jaroje noted that at first, it was people pointing and giving him the thumbs down, then it escalated to people screaming out of their cars and giving him middle fingers. Some motorists have reportedly also cut off the Tesla owner’s Cybertruck. A “Nazis F**k Off” sticker had been placed on his Cybertruck earlier this month. Clients are reportedly canceling their appointments due to his support of Musk and his Tesla, and his social media has been saturated with abuse. The Tesla owner also received a voice message that stated, “Please do the world a favor and put a bullet right between your tiny brain. ”The Cybertruck owner also shared a threatening message he received, which noted, “Oh, you better watch out because somebody someday will cut you off, and a bad guy will have a gun. ” A potential move: Ironically, the Tesla owner is an immigrant from Syria, which he fled due to violence. But with the abuse being hurled at himself and his vehicle, Dr. Jaroje is now considering moving away from Massachusetts with his wife and three children. “I remember President Trump saying, ‘Fight, fight, fight,’ you know. Is it fair for me to just eradicate my roots from here and take my kids away?” The Tesla owner noted. The Tesla owner’s segment with NBC 10 Boston can be viewed below.

2025 A Tesla Cybertruck owner from Austin, Texas recently shared a number of insights following a demo drive of the new Model Y. Tesla recently started offering demo drives of the revamped all-electric crossover. Based on posters that have been shared on social media media, it appears that test drives of the new Model Y were offered in Austin and Dallas, Texas. New Model Y general observations: Tesla Cybertruck owner @VoyageATXBen shared some of his impressions of the new Model Y on social media platform X. As per the Tesla owner, the new Model Y’s suspension was incredible as the vehicle felt extremely solid when going over bumps or imperfections on the road. Regen reportedly felt quite stronger than the Model Y classic, and the brake pedal itself felt much more firm. Ride quality-wise, the new Model Y reportedly felt very similar to the reengineered Tesla Model 3, which received widespread acclaim for its upgraded suspension system. I drove the new Model Y today! Here are some initial impressions:The new suspension is LEGENDARY. Going over bumps feels super solid and no longer includes a reverb/rattle noise. To me, regen felt stronger than the previous vehicle, the vehicle now also gives you the ability… pic. twitter. com/CjpN6tqzxI— Ben (@VoyageATXBen) February 16, 2025 New Model Y cabin: The Cybertruck owner praised the new Model Y’s cabin, which he noted was so quiet, it felt like he was wearing noise-cancelling headphones. The materials on the cabin and seats are reportedly a step up from the Model Y classic. The buttons on the new Model Y’s steering wheel reportedly felt like physical buttons as well. That being said, the Tesla owner noted that the single turn stalk felt almost cheap, perhaps because it was extremely light. The Tesla owner also observed that rear visibility has not improved from the Model Y classic since the revamped vehicle still has a slim rear windshield. The new model Y AC has a swing mode! It basically swings the vent left and right…neat!More initial impressions to come. This thing ROCKS pic. twitter. com/Azg376H7OP— Ben (@VoyageATXBen) February 16, 2025 Interesting features: The Cybertruck owner also shared a number of interesting observations of the new Model Y’s features during his test drive. For one, the demo unit that Tesla was offering for test drives had adaptive headlights enabled. The new Model Y’s air conditioning system also had a swing mode that vents air left and right, which was pretty neat. Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

Powerwall Powerpack Supercharger TSLA SPACEX ELON MUSK The Boring Company Hyperloop Artificial Intelligence MARKETPLACE News Tesla Model S Standard Range still resilient 250k miles later Credit: Out of Spec Studios/YouTube By Simon Alvarez Posted on February 17, 2025 A recent study has determined that even a very high mileage Tesla Model S on its original battery can perform well as a legitimate road tripping machine. This was demonstrated in a recent test from Out of Spec Testing involving a 2019 Tesla Model S Standard Range. The vehicle: For its test, the Out of Spec team used a 2019 Tesla Model S Standard Range, which was still equipped with its original 75 kWh battery. At its time of release, the Model S Standard Range had an EPA range rating of 285 miles per charge. While the Model S Standard Range that was used in the test was only six years old, the all-electric sedan has racked up over 250,000 miles. This was one of the reasons why the vehicle was acquired for less than $10,000 with incentives and FSD. The test: Similar to its other range tests, the Out of Spec team opted to run the 250,000-mile Model S Standard Range from full charge to zero at 70 mph on the highway. The conditions of the test did not seem very ideal for an electric vehicle, especially one that has racked up a quarter of a million miles in six years. As per Out of Spec team member Ryan Kassel, 20 mph winds were abounding during the day, and temperatures ranged from the 40s to the 50s. My friends bought a 250,000mi Model S *Raven* for $9,000 and it included FSD!Videos coming on this insane deal and how well the car has held up@RyanKassel ran it in the range, charging, and 10% challenge tests yesterday ⚡️ pic. twitter. com/XDu23MzU7U— Kyle Conner (@itskyleconner) February 6, 2025 The results: Despite these subpar conditions, the 2019 Model S Standard Range was able to travel 203 miles at 70 mph before the Out of Spec team called the test. As per the Out of Spec team, the Model S Standard Range consumed 57. 8 kWh of its battery during the test. The Model S Standard Range actually proved very efficient, doing 3. 6 miles per kWh. This is pretty impressive and close to the new Model 3 Performance, which did 3. 8 miles per kWh during the team’s 70 mph range test. Tesla longevity: A recent study published in Nature has stated that Tesla’s vehicles lead the industry and mileage. As per the study, Tesla’s electric vehicles are expected to cover an average of 204,000 miles over their lifetime, surpassing all other brands regardless of powertrain. Electric vehicles in the study had an average estimated mileage of 124,000 miles. Tesla’s electric vehicles have an estimated lifespan of 20. 3 years based on the study’s calculations.

of Spec Studios/YouTube By Simon Alvarez Posted on February 17, 2025 A recent study has determined that even a very high mileage Tesla Model S on its original battery can perform well as a legitimate road tripping machine. This was demonstrated in a recent test from Out of Spec Testing involving a 2019 Tesla Model S Standard Range. The vehicle: For its test, the Out of Spec team used a 2019 Tesla Model S Standard Range, which was still equipped with its original 75 kWh battery. At its time of release, the Model S Standard Range had an EPA range rating of 285 miles per charge. While the Model S Standard Range that was used in the test was only six years old, the all-electric sedan has racked up over 250,000 miles. This was one of the reasons why the vehicle was acquired for less than $10,000 with incentives and FSD. The test: Similar to its other range tests, the Out of Spec team opted to run the 250,000-mile Model S Standard Range from full charge to zero at 70 mph on the highway. The conditions of the test did not seem very ideal for an electric vehicle, especially one that has racked up a quarter of a million miles in six years. As per Out of Spec team member Ryan Kassel, 20 mph winds were abounding during the day, and temperatures ranged from the 40s to the 50s. My friends bought a 250,000mi Model S *Raven* for $9,000 and it included FSD!Videos coming on this insane deal and how well the car has held up@RyanKassel ran it in the range, charging, and 10% challenge tests yesterday ⚡️ pic. twitter. com/XDu23MzU7U— Kyle Conner (@itskyleconner) February 6, 2025 The results: Despite these subpar conditions, the 2019 Model S Standard Range was able to travel 203 miles at 70 mph before the Out of Spec team called the test. As per the Out of Spec team, the Model S Standard Range consumed 57. 8 kWh of its battery during the test. The Model S Standard Range actually proved very efficient, doing 3. 6 miles per kWh. This is pretty impressive and close to the new Model 3 Performance, which did 3. 8 miles per kWh during the team’s 70 mph range test. Tesla longevity: A recent study published in Nature has stated that Tesla’s vehicles lead the industry and mileage. As per the study, Tesla’s electric vehicles are expected to cover an average of 204,000 miles over their lifetime, surpassing all other brands regardless of powertrain. Electric vehicles in the study had an average estimated mileage of 124,000 miles. Tesla’s electric vehicles have an estimated lifespan of 20. 3 years based on the study’s calculations.

SPACEX ELON MUSK The Boring Company Hyperloop Artificial Intelligence MARKETPLACE News Tesla FSD release in China faces potential delay (Credit: Tesla Asia/X) By Maria Merano Posted on February 17, 2025 Tesla Full Self-Driving’s (FSD) release in China is facing a potential delay as tensions rise between the US and Chinese governments. Financial Times sources in China hinted that Tesla FSD’s license approval might be used as a bargaining chip after U. S. President Trump implemented a 10% additional tariff on imported Chinese goods. China seeks to negotiate with President Trump. Tesla FSD’s rollout in Mexico is a bigger deal than it seems Tesla FSD was initially expected to roll out in China and Europe by the first quarter of 2025. However, the timeline for releasing Full Self-Driving in China might be pushed back, considering the situation between the U. S. and China. During Tesla’s full-year and Q4 2024 earnings call, Elon Musk talked about a few challenges the company faces in China with regard to FSD. “Then China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they weren’t — they currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government won’t let us do training in China. So, we’re in a bit of a there. It’s like a quandary,” Musk commented. As for Europe, Musk predicted Tesla FSD might be approved by May 2025. The Tesla CEO noted that the company has to pass through many regulations before FSD receives approval in Europe.

Tesla Cybertruck owner ponders leaving MA with wife and kids over death threats, abuse Credit: NBC 10 Boston/YouTube By Simon Alvarez Posted on February 17, 2025 A Tesla Cybertruck owner from Massachusetts is considering moving with his wife and three children over the abuse and harassment he is experiencing due to his vehicle. The Tesla owner noted that reactions to his Cybertruck became extremely negative following CEO Elon Musk’s declaration of support for U. S. President Donald Trump. The Cybertruck: Tesla owner Dr. Kumait Jaroje wrapped his Cybertruck in gold to promote his medical spa business. With Elon Musk’s close ties to Trump and his administration, as well as his work with DOGE, the Tesla owner noted that his vehicle, as well as he himself, has become the target of much abuse. “The salute happened, Musk, during the inauguration of Trump, and that’s when everything went crazy,” the Tesla owner told NBC 10 Boston. The threats: Dr. Jaroje noted that at first, it was people pointing and giving him the thumbs down, then it escalated to people screaming out of their cars and giving him middle fingers. Some motorists have reportedly also cut off the Tesla owner’s Cybertruck. A “Nazis F**k Off” sticker had been placed on his Cybertruck earlier this month. Clients are reportedly canceling their appointments due to his support of Musk and his Tesla, and his social media has been saturated with abuse. The Tesla owner also received a voice message that stated, “Please do the world a favor and put a bullet right between your tiny brain. ”The Cybertruck owner also shared a threatening message he received, which noted, “Oh, you better watch out because somebody someday will cut you off, and a bad guy will have a gun. ” A potential move: Ironically, the Tesla owner is an immigrant from Syria, which he fled due to violence. But with the abuse being hurled at himself and his vehicle, Dr. Jaroje is now considering moving away from Massachusetts with his wife and three children. “I remember President Trump saying, ‘Fight, fight, fight,’ you know. Is it fair for me to just eradicate my roots from here and take my kids away?” The Tesla owner noted. The Tesla owner’s segment with NBC 10 Boston can be viewed below.

Merano Posted on February 17, 2025 Tesla nabbed a new institutional investor despite all the hate Elon Musk receives worldwide from people who disagree with his latest political moves. Attessa Capital LLC, an investment adviser firm, acquired a new stake in Tesla in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to a 13F filing with the United States Securities \u0026 Exchange Commission, Attessa Capital acquired 2,703 TSLA shares, valued at approximately $1,092,000. The investment company’s Tesla shares account for 0. 7% of its holdings. Tesla is the 19th largest holding for Attessa Capital. A few other institutional investors bought Tesla shares before the end of 2024. For instance, World Investment Advisors LLC raised its stake in TSLA during Q3 2024 by 1,248. 9%. Data gathered by MarketBeat revealed that Tesla has an average rating of “Hold” and a consensus target price of $326. 50 from Wall Street analysts. Trump expects to launch broader automobile tariffs in April Tesla has come far from the days when a simple comment from Elon Musk could tank the stock or raise it to new heights. Many Tesla customers and retail investors have vocally disagreed with Musk’s current political roles and opinions recently. Some reports suggest that Musk’s political influence would affect Tesla’s global sales. However, Elon Musk and Tesla sales might not be as linked as they were a few years ago.

Im Januar 2022 erklärte er dann, dass es diesbezüglich noch „viele Herausforderungen“ gebe. Er nannte die hohen Importzölle – sie betrugen damals 100 Prozent auf Elektroautos im Wert von über 40. 000 Dollar. Im vergangenen Jahr senkte Indien diese Zölle für Autobauer, die 500 Millionen Dollar in Indien investieren und dort binnen drei Jahren eine Produktion starten. Bislang machen Elektroautos in Indien nur einen geringen Teil der Neuzulassungen aus – eine Chance für Tesla. Der US-Autobauer kämpft gegen die wachsende Konkurrenz chinesischer Hersteller; im vergangenen Jahr ging der Absatz erstmals überhaupt zurück. red, ORF. at/Agenturen Zurück zur Startseite News Sport Wetter Österreich Debatte Sound Topos ORF ON ORF KIDS Fernsehen Radio Alle ORF-Angebote Kontakt Datenschutzerklärung Datenschutzeinstellungen Offenlegung Bekanntgabe laut ORF-G Publikumsrat ORF. at Nicht alle Bilder konnten vollständig geladen werden.

Er nannte die hohen Importzölle – sie betrugen damals 100 Prozent auf Elektroautos im Wert von über 40. 000 Dollar. Im vergangenen Jahr senkte Indien diese Zölle für Autobauer, die 500 Millionen Dollar in Indien investieren und dort binnen drei Jahren eine Produktion starten. Bislang machen Elektroautos in Indien nur einen geringen Teil der Neuzulassungen aus – eine Chance für Tesla. Der US-Autobauer kämpft gegen die wachsende Konkurrenz chinesischer Hersteller; im vergangenen Jahr ging der Absatz erstmals überhaupt zurück. red, ORF. at/Agenturen Zurück zur Startseite News Sport Wetter Österreich Debatte Sound Topos ORF ON ORF KIDS Fernsehen Radio Alle ORF-Angebote Kontakt Datenschutzerklärung Datenschutzeinstellungen Offenlegung Bekanntgabe laut ORF-G Publikumsrat ORF. at Nicht alle Bilder konnten vollständig geladen werden.
