Photo by: NHTSA Iulian Dnistran By: Iulian Dnistran Feb 19, at 8:11am ET Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Share Comment The first public crash test of the Tesla Cybertruck has been conducted by the NHTSA. The angular electric pickup scored a five-star safety rating, the highest possible. All the Tesla models tested by the NHTSA to date have scored five stars. The Tesla Cybertruck finally has an official crash safety rating more than a year after deliveries began in Nov. 2023. The result is impressive: five stars overall and in almost all individual categories. The U. S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crashed several 2024 Tesla Cybertrucks as part of the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). Let’s start with the frontal crash test, which simulates a head-on collision between two similar vehicles where the test vehicle crashes into a flat, rigid barrier at 35 miles per hour. In this test, the NHTSA awarded a five-star safety rating for the driver and a four-star rating for the passenger.

The Tesla Cybertruck Was A Hit In 2024, But The Hype Is Fading The Tesla Cybertruck Is Now Cheaper Thanks To The $7,500 Tax Credit The report mentions that both the driver and passenger airbags deployed properly in this test, but that neither the passenger knee airbag nor the driver knee airbag deployed. Tesla confirmed that the knee airbags are designed to remain undeployed for this specific test. In the side crash test, the Cybertruck received an overall safety score of five stars. This category is comprised of two individual tests which are then combined into a single big rating. There’s the side barrier test, which simulates an intersection collision between two vehicles, and the side pole test, which simulates a vehicle colliding into a fixed object like a tree or utility pole. Gallery: Tesla Cybertruck NHTSA Crash Test 3 NHTSA In the side barrier test, a moving non-rigid barrier angled at 27 degrees is crashed into the driver’s side of the test vehicle at 38. 5 mph. In the side pole test, the test vehicle is angled at 75 degrees and crashed into a rigid pole at 20 mph. In each of these individual tests, the Cybertruck received a five-star rating, both for the front seat and rear seat. Finally, the Tesla Cybertruck received a four-star rating (out of a maximum of five stars) in the rollover resistance test, which measures the risk of rollover in a single-vehicle, loss-of-control scenario. The NHTSA noted that the Cybertruck did not tip during the dynamic test, but that there is a rollover risk of 12. 4%. The crash tests were performed late last year by Applus+ Idiada Karco Engineering in Adelanto, California. The NHTSA published the final reports of the crash tests on January 15. To date, every Tesla vehicle tested by the NHTSA has received a five-star overall safety rating.

Photo by: NHTSA Iulian Dnistran By: Iulian Dnistran Feb 19, at 8:11am ET Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Share Comment The first public crash test of the Tesla Cybertruck has been conducted by the NHTSA. The angular electric pickup scored a five-star safety rating, the highest possible. All the Tesla models tested by the NHTSA to date have scored five stars. The Tesla Cybertruck finally has an official crash safety rating more than a year after deliveries began in Nov. 2023. The result is impressive: five stars overall and in almost all individual categories. The U. S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crashed several 2024 Tesla Cybertrucks as part of the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). Let’s start with the frontal crash test, which simulates a head-on collision between two similar vehicles where the test vehicle crashes into a flat, rigid barrier at 35 miles per hour. In this test, the NHTSA awarded a five-star safety rating for the driver and a four-star rating for the passenger.

The Tesla Cybertruck Was A Hit In 2024, But The Hype Is Fading The Tesla Cybertruck Is Now Cheaper Thanks To The $7,500 Tax Credit The report mentions that both the driver and passenger airbags deployed properly in this test, but that neither the passenger knee airbag nor the driver knee airbag deployed. Tesla confirmed that the knee airbags are designed to remain undeployed for this specific test. In the side crash test, the Cybertruck received an overall safety score of five stars. This category is comprised of two individual tests which are then combined into a single big rating. There’s the side barrier test, which simulates an intersection collision between two vehicles, and the side pole test, which simulates a vehicle colliding into a fixed object like a tree or utility pole. Gallery: Tesla Cybertruck NHTSA Crash Test 3 NHTSA In the side barrier test, a moving non-rigid barrier angled at 27 degrees is crashed into the driver’s side of the test vehicle at 38. 5 mph. In the side pole test, the test vehicle is angled at 75 degrees and crashed into a rigid pole at 20 mph. In each of these individual tests, the Cybertruck received a five-star rating, both for the front seat and rear seat. Finally, the Tesla Cybertruck received a four-star rating (out of a maximum of five stars) in the rollover resistance test, which measures the risk of rollover in a single-vehicle, loss-of-control scenario. The NHTSA noted that the Cybertruck did not tip during the dynamic test, but that there is a rollover risk of 12. 4%. The crash tests were performed late last year by Applus+ Idiada Karco Engineering in Adelanto, California. The NHTSA published the final reports of the crash tests on January 15. To date, every Tesla vehicle tested by the NHTSA has received a five-star overall safety rating.

Many people doubted the safety of such a design, especially after a couple of fatal crashes early after the truck hit the roads. Tesla had claimed the vehicle to be just as safe if not safer than its other vehicles, which all received top safety ratings, but it hadn’t been independently tested… until now. NHTSA has now crash-tested the Cybertruck and gave it a 5-star safety rating: For the frontal collision test, the Cybertruck got a 5-star rating for the driver and 4-star rating for the passenger: The Cybertruck completely aced the side crash test: As for the rollover test, the Cybertruck got a 12. 40% rollover risk in a single-vehicle, loss-of-control scenario – resulting in a 4-star rating. The Cybertruck, which is equipped with the same ADAS system as Tesla’s other vehicles, also met the performance criteria for all the active safety features. However, one safety aspect that is not rated is pedestrian safety. Due to its shape and sharp edges, many have been concerned about the Cybertruck’s safety in a collision with a pedestrian. NHTSA has been working on new rules to asses the safety of a vehicle for not only people inside the vehicle, but also for other road users. Add Electrek to your Google News feed.

Many people doubted the safety of such a design, especially after a couple of fatal crashes early after the truck hit the roads. Tesla had claimed the vehicle to be just as safe if not safer than its other vehicles, which all received top safety ratings, but it hadn’t been independently tested… until now. NHTSA has now crash-tested the Cybertruck and gave it a 5-star safety rating: For the frontal collision test, the Cybertruck got a 5-star rating for the driver and 4-star rating for the passenger: The Cybertruck completely aced the side crash test: As for the rollover test, the Cybertruck got a 12. 40% rollover risk in a single-vehicle, loss-of-control scenario – resulting in a 4-star rating. The Cybertruck, which is equipped with the same ADAS system as Tesla’s other vehicles, also met the performance criteria for all the active safety features. However, one safety aspect that is not rated is pedestrian safety. Due to its shape and sharp edges, many have been concerned about the Cybertruck’s safety in a collision with a pedestrian. NHTSA has been working on new rules to asses the safety of a vehicle for not only people inside the vehicle, but also for other road users. Add Electrek to your Google News feed.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) The S\u0026P 500 added to its record Wednesday as US stock indexes drifted through a quiet, mixed day on Wall Street. The S\u0026P 500 rose 14. 57 points, or 0. 2%, to 6,144. 15 after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 71. 25 points, or 0. 2%, to 44,627. 59. The Nasdaq composite rose 14. 99 points, or 0. 1%, to 20,056. 25. Elon Musk's Tesla was one of the strongest forces lifting the market. It rose 1. 8% after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 39. 1% following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it will try to sell off its assets and wind down its business. A 9. 7% rally for Analog Devices also helped push the S\u0026P 500 higher, the AP reports. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a \"challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop. \" They helped offset a 21. 5% tumble for Celanese, which dropped even though the chemical company reported profit for the end of 2024 that topped analysts' expectations. CEO Scott Richardson warned that it saw \"demand deterioration that gave no sign of easing\" during the last three months of the year, and the company expects weakness to continue for such core markets as automotive, construction, and paints. Toll Brothers, meanwhile, fell 5. 8% after the homebuilder reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. said this spring selling season has seen healthy demand so far for homes at the higher end of the price spectrum, but \"affordability constraints\" are hurting sales at the lower end. A separate report on Wednesday morning said homebuilders as a group broke ground on fewer US houses last month than economists expected. High mortgage rates are making it difficult for some potential homebuyers to afford a house, even though the Federal Reserve began cutting its main interest rate in September in order to make things easier for the economy.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) The S\u0026P 500 added to its record Wednesday as US stock indexes drifted through a quiet, mixed day on Wall Street. The S\u0026P 500 rose 14. 57 points, or 0. 2%, to 6,144. 15 after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 71. 25 points, or 0. 2%, to 44,627. 59. The Nasdaq composite rose 14. 99 points, or 0. 1%, to 20,056. 25. Elon Musk's Tesla was one of the strongest forces lifting the market. It rose 1. 8% after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 39. 1% following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it will try to sell off its assets and wind down its business. A 9. 7% rally for Analog Devices also helped push the S\u0026P 500 higher, the AP reports. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a \"challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop. \" They helped offset a 21. 5% tumble for Celanese, which dropped even though the chemical company reported profit for the end of 2024 that topped analysts' expectations. CEO Scott Richardson warned that it saw \"demand deterioration that gave no sign of easing\" during the last three months of the year, and the company expects weakness to continue for such core markets as automotive, construction, and paints. Toll Brothers, meanwhile, fell 5. 8% after the homebuilder reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. said this spring selling season has seen healthy demand so far for homes at the higher end of the price spectrum, but \"affordability constraints\" are hurting sales at the lower end. A separate report on Wednesday morning said homebuilders as a group broke ground on fewer US houses last month than economists expected. High mortgage rates are making it difficult for some potential homebuyers to afford a house, even though the Federal Reserve began cutting its main interest rate in September in order to make things easier for the economy.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) The S\u0026P 500 added to its record Wednesday as US stock indexes drifted through a quiet, mixed day on Wall Street. The S\u0026P 500 rose 14. 57 points, or 0. 2%, to 6,144. 15 after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 71. 25 points, or 0. 2%, to 44,627. 59. The Nasdaq composite rose 14. 99 points, or 0. 1%, to 20,056. 25. Elon Musk's Tesla was one of the strongest forces lifting the market. It rose 1. 8% after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 39. 1% following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it will try to sell off its assets and wind down its business. A 9. 7% rally for Analog Devices also helped push the S\u0026P 500 higher, the AP reports. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a \"challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop. \" They helped offset a 21. 5% tumble for Celanese, which dropped even though the chemical company reported profit for the end of 2024 that topped analysts' expectations. CEO Scott Richardson warned that it saw \"demand deterioration that gave no sign of easing\" during the last three months of the year, and the company expects weakness to continue for such core markets as automotive, construction, and paints. Toll Brothers, meanwhile, fell 5. 8% after the homebuilder reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. said this spring selling season has seen healthy demand so far for homes at the higher end of the price spectrum, but \"affordability constraints\" are hurting sales at the lower end. A separate report on Wednesday morning said homebuilders as a group broke ground on fewer US houses last month than economists expected. High mortgage rates are making it difficult for some potential homebuyers to afford a house, even though the Federal Reserve began cutting its main interest rate in September in order to make things easier for the economy.

The new energy center is part of the five-phase Samson \u0026 Delilah solar project – one of the largest solar facilities under construction in the whole of the United States. The Delilah I Solar Energy Center – situated in Lamar and Red River counties – is now online and has managed to secured two very big customers in Tesla and Honda. The two car manufacturers have agreed to purchase all the power created at the solar farm through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and it will be fed into the local grid. The carmakers will purchase all the power produced at the solar farm Delilah I will generate renewable energy under a long-term power purchase agreement with the two automakers. Honda has signed up to take 200 megawatts and Tesla will take the remaining 100 megawatts – meaning if you purchase a new Tesla or Honda in the upcoming months or years, it’s possible this renewable energy was used to make it. Tesla The WEC Energy Group owns 90% of Delilah I which invested $459 million into the project and already owns a majority interest in Samson I – a separate phase of the Samson \u0026 Delilah project. “The Delilah Solar project is an exciting addition to our Infrastructure business and highlights our continued investment in affordable, reliable and clean energy,” said WEC Energy Group chairman, Gale Klappa. “This project will help one of the world’s largest automakers meet their clean energy goals for years to come. ” Delilah I will help Tesla and Honda meet their ‘clean energy goals’ More and more companies are making efforts to ‘go green’ when it comes to their energy use – including Honda and Tesla. Honda says buying power from Delilah I will help it achieve its goal of using 100% carbon-free electricity in the US. Invenergy “In North America, Honda is nearing its goal of sourcing 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources,” said carbon neutrality manager at American Honda, Daniel Bremer. “As we accelerate toward achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, our 200 MW VPPA with Delilah I Solar Energy Center will significantly cut CO2 emissions from Honda US auto manufacturing operations while adding more clean energy into the local grid. ” While Delilah I is unquestionably a huge source of renewable energy in the US, it’s absolutely dwarfed by the world’s largest renewable energy park that opened up in India last year and is five times bigger than Paris. The super-sized park is aiming to produce a staggering 500GW by 2030.

The new energy center is part of the five-phase Samson \u0026 Delilah solar project – one of the largest solar facilities under construction in the whole of the United States. The Delilah I Solar Energy Center – situated in Lamar and Red River counties – is now online and has managed to secured two very big customers in Tesla and Honda. The two car manufacturers have agreed to purchase all the power created at the solar farm through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and it will be fed into the local grid. The carmakers will purchase all the power produced at the solar farm Delilah I will generate renewable energy under a long-term power purchase agreement with the two automakers. Honda has signed up to take 200 megawatts and Tesla will take the remaining 100 megawatts – meaning if you purchase a new Tesla or Honda in the upcoming months or years, it’s possible this renewable energy was used to make it. Tesla The WEC Energy Group owns 90% of Delilah I which invested $459 million into the project and already owns a majority interest in Samson I – a separate phase of the Samson \u0026 Delilah project. “The Delilah Solar project is an exciting addition to our Infrastructure business and highlights our continued investment in affordable, reliable and clean energy,” said WEC Energy Group chairman, Gale Klappa. “This project will help one of the world’s largest automakers meet their clean energy goals for years to come. ” Delilah I will help Tesla and Honda meet their ‘clean energy goals’ More and more companies are making efforts to ‘go green’ when it comes to their energy use – including Honda and Tesla. Honda says buying power from Delilah I will help it achieve its goal of using 100% carbon-free electricity in the US. Invenergy “In North America, Honda is nearing its goal of sourcing 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources,” said carbon neutrality manager at American Honda, Daniel Bremer. “As we accelerate toward achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, our 200 MW VPPA with Delilah I Solar Energy Center will significantly cut CO2 emissions from Honda US auto manufacturing operations while adding more clean energy into the local grid. ” While Delilah I is unquestionably a huge source of renewable energy in the US, it’s absolutely dwarfed by the world’s largest renewable energy park that opened up in India last year and is five times bigger than Paris. The super-sized park is aiming to produce a staggering 500GW by 2030.

The new energy center is part of the five-phase Samson \u0026 Delilah solar project – one of the largest solar facilities under construction in the whole of the United States. The Delilah I Solar Energy Center – situated in Lamar and Red River counties – is now online and has managed to secured two very big customers in Tesla and Honda. The two car manufacturers have agreed to purchase all the power created at the solar farm through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and it will be fed into the local grid. The carmakers will purchase all the power produced at the solar farm Delilah I will generate renewable energy under a long-term power purchase agreement with the two automakers. Honda has signed up to take 200 megawatts and Tesla will take the remaining 100 megawatts – meaning if you purchase a new Tesla or Honda in the upcoming months or years, it’s possible this renewable energy was used to make it. Tesla The WEC Energy Group owns 90% of Delilah I which invested $459 million into the project and already owns a majority interest in Samson I – a separate phase of the Samson \u0026 Delilah project. “The Delilah Solar project is an exciting addition to our Infrastructure business and highlights our continued investment in affordable, reliable and clean energy,” said WEC Energy Group chairman, Gale Klappa. “This project will help one of the world’s largest automakers meet their clean energy goals for years to come. ” Delilah I will help Tesla and Honda meet their ‘clean energy goals’ More and more companies are making efforts to ‘go green’ when it comes to their energy use – including Honda and Tesla. Honda says buying power from Delilah I will help it achieve its goal of using 100% carbon-free electricity in the US. Invenergy “In North America, Honda is nearing its goal of sourcing 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources,” said carbon neutrality manager at American Honda, Daniel Bremer. “As we accelerate toward achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, our 200 MW VPPA with Delilah I Solar Energy Center will significantly cut CO2 emissions from Honda US auto manufacturing operations while adding more clean energy into the local grid. ” While Delilah I is unquestionably a huge source of renewable energy in the US, it’s absolutely dwarfed by the world’s largest renewable energy park that opened up in India last year and is five times bigger than Paris. The super-sized park is aiming to produce a staggering 500GW by 2030.

The new energy center is part of the five-phase Samson \u0026 Delilah solar project – one of the largest solar facilities under construction in the whole of the United States. The Delilah I Solar Energy Center – situated in Lamar and Red River counties – is now online and has managed to secured two very big customers in Tesla and Honda. The two car manufacturers have agreed to purchase all the power created at the solar farm through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and it will be fed into the local grid. The carmakers will purchase all the power produced at the solar farm Delilah I will generate renewable energy under a long-term power purchase agreement with the two automakers. Honda has signed up to take 200 megawatts and Tesla will take the remaining 100 megawatts – meaning if you purchase a new Tesla or Honda in the upcoming months or years, it’s possible this renewable energy was used to make it. Tesla The WEC Energy Group owns 90% of Delilah I which invested $459 million into the project and already owns a majority interest in Samson I – a separate phase of the Samson \u0026 Delilah project. “The Delilah Solar project is an exciting addition to our Infrastructure business and highlights our continued investment in affordable, reliable and clean energy,” said WEC Energy Group chairman, Gale Klappa. “This project will help one of the world’s largest automakers meet their clean energy goals for years to come. ” Delilah I will help Tesla and Honda meet their ‘clean energy goals’ More and more companies are making efforts to ‘go green’ when it comes to their energy use – including Honda and Tesla. Honda says buying power from Delilah I will help it achieve its goal of using 100% carbon-free electricity in the US. Invenergy “In North America, Honda is nearing its goal of sourcing 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources,” said carbon neutrality manager at American Honda, Daniel Bremer. “As we accelerate toward achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, our 200 MW VPPA with Delilah I Solar Energy Center will significantly cut CO2 emissions from Honda US auto manufacturing operations while adding more clean energy into the local grid. ” While Delilah I is unquestionably a huge source of renewable energy in the US, it’s absolutely dwarfed by the world’s largest renewable energy park that opened up in India last year and is five times bigger than Paris. The super-sized park is aiming to produce a staggering 500GW by 2030.

The new station will be located near the 405 and 110 freeway corridors just outside of Carson in California. The site will be used to charge the fleet of Tesla’s all-electric trucks – known as the Tesla Semi. Tesla has already built a similar Megacharger station, but this one is situated at the Gigafactory Nevada and is designed to be used only by the company’s internal fleet of Tesla Semi trucks. DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie The Megacharger will support the Tesla Semi Tesla began orders for the Semi in 2022, with first deliveries made later that year. A handful of companies including PepsiCo and Target currently use the EVs to ship and carry their goods. However, the manufacturer is hoping to ramp up production of the trucks in late 2025 or early 2026 and is hopeful the Semi could become one of its biggest products. Tesla With the fleet set to expand over the coming months and years, Tesla has filed a permit to build its first-ever public Semi Megacharger. Previous Megacharger sites have only been opened at private corporate facilities with no access for the general public. However, although the filing lists the Megacharger as ‘public’, it’s believed that the units will be exclusive to the Semi – unlike Superchargers, which are now open to owners of other EV brands. The new site will include a lounge area and restrooms Plans included in the permit filing show the EV maker is planning to create 12 stalls with Megachargers that can accommodate the trucks and their trailers. The company has previously said its Semi can regain up to 70 percent of its 500-mile range in just 30 minutes – meaning drivers won’t need to spend too long at the Megacharger before getting back on the road. MarcoRPi1 But as well as providing a place for the fleet of Semi trucks to charge, the permits, which were shared online by an X user called MarcoRPi1, also revealed plans to build a 1,600-square-foot building, with a lounge area, restrooms, vending machines, and more. There will also be a place for staff to park their cars. As yet, it’s unclear when construction will begin on the new Megacharger site. # Tags - EV, Tesla # Tags - EV, Tesla Claire Reid Claire Reid is a journalist who hails from the UK but is now living in New Zealand.

The new station will be located near the 405 and 110 freeway corridors just outside of Carson in California. The site will be used to charge the fleet of Tesla’s all-electric trucks – known as the Tesla Semi. Tesla has already built a similar Megacharger station, but this one is situated at the Gigafactory Nevada and is designed to be used only by the company’s internal fleet of Tesla Semi trucks.

A handful of companies including PepsiCo and Target currently use the EVs to ship and carry their goods. However, the manufacturer is hoping to ramp up production of the trucks in late 2025 or early 2026 and is hopeful the Semi could become one of its biggest products. Tesla With the fleet set to expand over the coming months and years, Tesla has filed a permit to build its first-ever public Semi Megacharger. Previous Megacharger sites have only been opened at private corporate facilities with no access for the general public. However, although the filing lists the Megacharger as ‘public’, it’s believed that the units will be exclusive to the Semi – unlike Superchargers, which are now open to owners of other EV brands. The new site will include a lounge area and restrooms Plans included in the permit filing show the EV maker is planning to create 12 stalls with Megachargers that can accommodate the trucks and their trailers. The company has previously said its Semi can regain up to 70 percent of its 500-mile range in just 30 minutes – meaning drivers won’t need to spend too long at the Megacharger before getting back on the road. MarcoRPi1 But as well as providing a place for the fleet of Semi trucks to charge, the permits, which were shared online by an X user called MarcoRPi1, also revealed plans to build a 1,600-square-foot building, with a lounge area, restrooms, vending machines, and more.

The new station will be located near the 405 and 110 freeway corridors just outside of Carson in California. The site will be used to charge the fleet of Tesla’s all-electric trucks – known as the Tesla Semi. Tesla has already built a similar Megacharger station, but this one is situated at the Gigafactory Nevada and is designed to be used only by the company’s internal fleet of Tesla Semi trucks. DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie The Megacharger will support the Tesla Semi Tesla began orders for the Semi in 2022, with first deliveries made later that year. A handful of companies including PepsiCo and Target currently use the EVs to ship and carry their goods. However, the manufacturer is hoping to ramp up production of the trucks in late 2025 or early 2026 and is hopeful the Semi could become one of its biggest products. Tesla With the fleet set to expand over the coming months and years, Tesla has filed a permit to build its first-ever public Semi Megacharger. Previous Megacharger sites have only been opened at private corporate facilities with no access for the general public. However, although the filing lists the Megacharger as ‘public’, it’s believed that the units will be exclusive to the Semi – unlike Superchargers, which are now open to owners of other EV brands. The new site will include a lounge area and restrooms Plans included in the permit filing show the EV maker is planning to create 12 stalls with Megachargers that can accommodate the trucks and their trailers. The company has previously said its Semi can regain up to 70 percent of its 500-mile range in just 30 minutes – meaning drivers won’t need to spend too long at the Megacharger before getting back on the road. MarcoRPi1 But as well as providing a place for the fleet of Semi trucks to charge, the permits, which were shared online by an X user called MarcoRPi1, also revealed plans to build a 1,600-square-foot building, with a lounge area, restrooms, vending machines, and more. There will also be a place for staff to park their cars. As yet, it’s unclear when construction will begin on the new Megacharger site. # Tags - EV, Tesla # Tags - EV, Tesla Claire Reid Claire Reid is a journalist who hails from the UK but is now living in New Zealand.

The new energy center is part of the five-phase Samson \u0026 Delilah solar project – one of the largest solar facilities under construction in the whole of the United States. The Delilah I Solar Energy Center – situated in Lamar and Red River counties – is now online and has managed to secure two very big customers in Tesla and Honda. The two car manufacturers have agreed to purchase all the power created at the solar farm through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and it will be fed into the local grid. The carmakers will purchase all the power produced at the solar farm Delilah I will generate renewable energy under a long-term power purchase agreement with the two automakers. Honda has signed up to take 200 megawatts and Tesla will take the remaining 100 megawatts – meaning if you purchase a new Tesla or Honda in the upcoming months or years, it’s possible this renewable energy was used to make it. Tesla The WEC Energy Group owns 90 percent of Delilah I which invested $459 million into the project and already owns a majority interest in Samson I – a separate phase of the Samson \u0026 Delilah project. “The Delilah Solar project is an exciting addition to our Infrastructure business and highlights our continued investment in affordable, reliable and clean energy,” WEC Energy Group chairman, Gale Klappa said. “This project will help one of the world’s largest automakers meet their clean energy goals for years to come. ” Delilah I will help Tesla and Honda meet their ‘clean energy goals’ More and more companies are making efforts to ‘go green’ when it comes to their energy use. Honda says buying power from Delilah I will help it achieve its goal of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity in the US. Invenergy “In North America, Honda is nearing its goal of sourcing 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources,” carbon neutrality manager at American Honda, Daniel Bremer said. “As we accelerate toward achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, our 200 MW VPPA with Delilah I Solar Energy Center will significantly cut CO2 emissions from Honda US auto manufacturing operations while adding more clean energy into the local grid. ” While Delilah I is unquestionably a huge source of renewable energy in the US, it’s absolutely dwarfed by the world’s largest renewable energy park that opened up in India last year and is five times bigger than Paris. The super-sized park is aiming to produce a staggering 500GW by 2030.

The new energy center is part of the five-phase Samson \u0026 Delilah solar project – one of the largest solar facilities under construction in the whole of the United States. The Delilah I Solar Energy Center – situated in Lamar and Red River counties – is now online and has managed to secure two very big customers in Tesla and Honda. The two car manufacturers have agreed to purchase all the power created at the solar farm through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and it will be fed into the local grid. The carmakers will purchase all the power produced at the solar farm Delilah I will generate renewable energy under a long-term power purchase agreement with the two automakers. Honda has signed up to take 200 megawatts and Tesla will take the remaining 100 megawatts – meaning if you purchase a new Tesla or Honda in the upcoming months or years, it’s possible this renewable energy was used to make it. Tesla The WEC Energy Group owns 90 percent of Delilah I which invested $459 million into the project and already owns a majority interest in Samson I – a separate phase of the Samson \u0026 Delilah project. “The Delilah Solar project is an exciting addition to our Infrastructure business and highlights our continued investment in affordable, reliable and clean energy,” WEC Energy Group chairman, Gale Klappa said. “This project will help one of the world’s largest automakers meet their clean energy goals for years to come. ” Delilah I will help Tesla and Honda meet their ‘clean energy goals’ More and more companies are making efforts to ‘go green’ when it comes to their energy use. Honda says buying power from Delilah I will help it achieve its goal of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity in the US. Invenergy “In North America, Honda is nearing its goal of sourcing 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources,” carbon neutrality manager at American Honda, Daniel Bremer said. “As we accelerate toward achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, our 200 MW VPPA with Delilah I Solar Energy Center will significantly cut CO2 emissions from Honda US auto manufacturing operations while adding more clean energy into the local grid. ” While Delilah I is unquestionably a huge source of renewable energy in the US, it’s absolutely dwarfed by the world’s largest renewable energy park that opened up in India last year and is five times bigger than Paris. The super-sized park is aiming to produce a staggering 500GW by 2030.

The new energy center is part of the five-phase Samson \u0026 Delilah solar project – one of the largest solar facilities under construction in the whole of the United States. The Delilah I Solar Energy Center – situated in Lamar and Red River counties – is now online and has managed to secure two very big customers in Tesla and Honda. The two car manufacturers have agreed to purchase all the power created at the solar farm through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and it will be fed into the local grid. The carmakers will purchase all the power produced at the solar farm Delilah I will generate renewable energy under a long-term power purchase agreement with the two automakers. Honda has signed up to take 200 megawatts and Tesla will take the remaining 100 megawatts – meaning if you purchase a new Tesla or Honda in the upcoming months or years, it’s possible this renewable energy was used to make it. Tesla The WEC Energy Group owns 90 percent of Delilah I which invested $459 million into the project and already owns a majority interest in Samson I – a separate phase of the Samson \u0026 Delilah project. “The Delilah Solar project is an exciting addition to our Infrastructure business and highlights our continued investment in affordable, reliable and clean energy,” WEC Energy Group chairman, Gale Klappa said. “This project will help one of the world’s largest automakers meet their clean energy goals for years to come. ” Delilah I will help Tesla and Honda meet their ‘clean energy goals’ More and more companies are making efforts to ‘go green’ when it comes to their energy use. Honda says buying power from Delilah I will help it achieve its goal of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity in the US. Invenergy “In North America, Honda is nearing its goal of sourcing 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources,” carbon neutrality manager at American Honda, Daniel Bremer said. “As we accelerate toward achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, our 200 MW VPPA with Delilah I Solar Energy Center will significantly cut CO2 emissions from Honda US auto manufacturing operations while adding more clean energy into the local grid. ” While Delilah I is unquestionably a huge source of renewable energy in the US, it’s absolutely dwarfed by the world’s largest renewable energy park that opened up in India last year and is five times bigger than Paris. The super-sized park is aiming to produce a staggering 500GW by 2030.

The new energy center is part of the five-phase Samson \u0026 Delilah solar project – one of the largest solar facilities under construction in the whole of the United States. The Delilah I Solar Energy Center – situated in Lamar and Red River counties – is now online and has managed to secure two very big customers in Tesla and Honda. The two car manufacturers have agreed to purchase all the power created at the solar farm through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) and it will be fed into the local grid. The carmakers will purchase all the power produced at the solar farm Delilah I will generate renewable energy under a long-term power purchase agreement with the two automakers. Honda has signed up to take 200 megawatts and Tesla will take the remaining 100 megawatts – meaning if you purchase a new Tesla or Honda in the upcoming months or years, it’s possible this renewable energy was used to make it. Tesla The WEC Energy Group owns 90 percent of Delilah I which invested $459 million into the project and already owns a majority interest in Samson I – a separate phase of the Samson \u0026 Delilah project. “The Delilah Solar project is an exciting addition to our Infrastructure business and highlights our continued investment in affordable, reliable and clean energy,” WEC Energy Group chairman, Gale Klappa said. “This project will help one of the world’s largest automakers meet their clean energy goals for years to come. ” Delilah I will help Tesla and Honda meet their ‘clean energy goals’ More and more companies are making efforts to ‘go green’ when it comes to their energy use. Honda says buying power from Delilah I will help it achieve its goal of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity in the US. Invenergy “In North America, Honda is nearing its goal of sourcing 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources,” carbon neutrality manager at American Honda, Daniel Bremer said. “As we accelerate toward achieving carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities, our 200 MW VPPA with Delilah I Solar Energy Center will significantly cut CO2 emissions from Honda US auto manufacturing operations while adding more clean energy into the local grid. ” While Delilah I is unquestionably a huge source of renewable energy in the US, it’s absolutely dwarfed by the world’s largest renewable energy park that opened up in India last year and is five times bigger than Paris. The super-sized park is aiming to produce a staggering 500GW by 2030.

Ma la perdita di capacità non significa che l'auto sia inutilizzabile dopo pochi anni. Anzi, le ultime ricerche dimostrano che gli accumulatori moderni si mantengono persino meglio delle vetture. Ma una cosa sono le statistiche, un'altra è sperimentare in prima persona. E quale modo migliore per dimostrare che si può guidare un veicolo elettrico dopo un-quarto di milione di miglia se non mostrare un veicolo elettrico in circolazione che ha superato le 250. 000 miglia (oltre 400. 000 km)? A esprimere il desiderio è il canale YouTube di Out of Spec Testing. Nel video incorporato qui sotto si vede una Tesla Model S Dual Motor Standard Range del 2019 ancora in funzione col pacco batterie originale. Quando era nuova, l'auto aveva una capacità totale di 75 kilowattora e un'autonomia stimata dall'EPA di 285 miglia (quasi 460 km). L'auto, usata, è stata acquistata a 9. 000 dollari, compresi gli incentivi. Nonostante i 250. 000 chilometri \"alle spalle\", la vettura conta ancora la garanzia batterie di Tesla. Le Model S precedenti al 2020 erano infatti coperte da una garanzia di 8 anni a chilometraggio illimitato nelle versioni con pacco batterie superiore a 70 kWh. Restano quindi 2 anni di garanzia. Ciò detto, il filmato immortala una prova dell'auto completamente carica, con la pressione degli pneumatici impostata secondo le raccomandazioni del costruttore, le sospensioni impostate all'altezza più bassa possibile, il climatizzatore impostato tra i 68 e i 72 gradi Fahrenheit (20-22 gradi Celsius) e la modalità Range (oggi non più disponibile) attiva. La temperatura ambiente era compresa tra 62 e 43 gradi Fahrenheit (16,5-6 gradi Celsius) e il vento soffiava a 20 miglia orarie (32 km/h) lungo tutto il tracciato. La velocità era impostata su 71 miglia orarie, che corrispondono a 70 miglia orarie sul GPS (112,5 e 114 km/h). Il test si è concluso dopo 203 miglia (326,7 km), perché l'auto non riusciva ad accelerare oltre le 67 miglia orarie (108 km/h), pur continuando a velocità inferiori. Tre miglia dopo (4,8 km), l'auto non accelerava affatto e consigliava al conducente di accostare. In totale, l'auto ha percorso 206 miglia (331,5 km) e utilizzato 57,8 kWh di energia, con un'efficienza media di 3,6 miglia/kWh (5,8 km/kWh). Per fare un confronto, una Tesla Model 3 Long Range del 2023, considerato un modello molto efficiente, ha una media di 3,9 miglia/kWh (quasi 6,3 km/kWh) nello stesso test. E il degrado della batteria? Il test ha rivelato un tasso del 23% dopo - appunto - 250. 000 miglia. Il dato esatto è però impossibile da determinare, perché i tester non conoscevano la capacità originale della batteria, visto che nessuno ha effettuato un test di autonomia quando l'auto era nuova.

Ma la perdita di capacità non significa che l'auto sia inutilizzabile dopo pochi anni. Anzi, le ultime ricerche dimostrano che gli accumulatori moderni si mantengono persino meglio delle vetture. Ma una cosa sono le statistiche, un'altra è sperimentare in prima persona. E quale modo migliore per dimostrare che si può guidare un veicolo elettrico dopo un-quarto di milione di miglia se non mostrare un veicolo elettrico in circolazione che ha superato le 250. 000 miglia (oltre 400. 000 km)? A esprimere il desiderio è il canale YouTube di Out of Spec Testing. Nel video incorporato qui sotto si vede una Tesla Model S Dual Motor Standard Range del 2019 ancora in funzione col pacco batterie originale. Quando era nuova, l'auto aveva una capacità totale di 75 kilowattora e un'autonomia stimata dall'EPA di 285 miglia (quasi 460 km). L'auto, usata, è stata acquistata a 9. 000 dollari, compresi gli incentivi. Nonostante i 250. 000 chilometri \"alle spalle\", la vettura conta ancora la garanzia batterie di Tesla. Le Model S precedenti al 2020 erano infatti coperte da una garanzia di 8 anni a chilometraggio illimitato nelle versioni con pacco batterie superiore a 70 kWh. Restano quindi 2 anni di garanzia. Ciò detto, il filmato immortala una prova dell'auto completamente carica, con la pressione degli pneumatici impostata secondo le raccomandazioni del costruttore, le sospensioni impostate all'altezza più bassa possibile, il climatizzatore impostato tra i 68 e i 72 gradi Fahrenheit (20-22 gradi Celsius) e la modalità Range (oggi non più disponibile) attiva. La temperatura ambiente era compresa tra 62 e 43 gradi Fahrenheit (16,5-6 gradi Celsius) e il vento soffiava a 20 miglia orarie (32 km/h) lungo tutto il tracciato. La velocità era impostata su 71 miglia orarie, che corrispondono a 70 miglia orarie sul GPS (112,5 e 114 km/h). Il test si è concluso dopo 203 miglia (326,7 km), perché l'auto non riusciva ad accelerare oltre le 67 miglia orarie (108 km/h), pur continuando a velocità inferiori. Tre miglia dopo (4,8 km), l'auto non accelerava affatto e consigliava al conducente di accostare. In totale, l'auto ha percorso 206 miglia (331,5 km) e utilizzato 57,8 kWh di energia, con un'efficienza media di 3,6 miglia/kWh (5,8 km/kWh). Per fare un confronto, una Tesla Model 3 Long Range del 2023, considerato un modello molto efficiente, ha una media di 3,9 miglia/kWh (quasi 6,3 km/kWh) nello stesso test. E il degrado della batteria? Il test ha rivelato un tasso del 23% dopo - appunto - 250. 000 miglia. Il dato esatto è però impossibile da determinare, perché i tester non conoscevano la capacità originale della batteria, visto che nessuno ha effettuato un test di autonomia quando l'auto era nuova.

The showrooms will be located in Aerocity, New Delhi, and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai, both high-traffic commercial zones. These will be standalone retail stores and not service outlets. Tesla's entry into India marks a significant step for the company, which had previously considered entering the Indian market in 2022 but postponed those plans due to regulatory barriers, high import duties, and infrastructure challenges. Overcoming these hurdles, Tesla refocused on establishing a retail presence in India last year, aiming to cultivate a local connection and support Indian consumers. Tesla's entry is expected to significantly impact India's EV industry by driving quicker EV growth through its advanced technology, revolutionary cars, and potential government support. The company's technology, competitive pricing, and possible government incentives could substantially increase the number of electric cars on Indian roads. This renewed effort gained momentum after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the United States. The discussions encompassed space, mobility, and technology, highlighting India's focus on promoting innovation and global partnerships. The showrooms in Delhi and Mumbai will span approximately 5,000 square feet. Tesla has also begun hiring for various positions in India, including store and customer relationship managers. Recent job listings indicate the company is seeking to fill 14 roles. Tesla is expected to introduce imported EVs from its Berlin plant, with prices starting around ₹21 lakh (approximately $25,000). While initial plans focus on imported vehicles, local production may be considered if sales volumes justify the investment.",

The showrooms will be located in Aerocity, New Delhi, and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai, both high-traffic commercial zones. These will be standalone retail stores and not service outlets. Tesla's entry into India marks a significant step for the company, which had previously considered entering the Indian market in 2022 but postponed those plans due to regulatory barriers, high import duties, and infrastructure challenges. Overcoming these hurdles, Tesla refocused on establishing a retail presence in India last year, aiming to cultivate a local connection and support Indian consumers. Tesla's entry is expected to significantly impact India's EV industry by driving quicker EV growth through its advanced technology, revolutionary cars, and potential government support. The company's technology, competitive pricing, and possible government incentives could substantially increase the number of electric cars on Indian roads. This renewed effort gained momentum after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the United States. The discussions encompassed space, mobility, and technology, highlighting India's focus on promoting innovation and global partnerships. The showrooms in Delhi and Mumbai will span approximately 5,000 square feet. Tesla has also begun hiring for various positions in India, including store and customer relationship managers. Recent job listings indicate the company is seeking to fill 14 roles. Tesla is expected to introduce imported EVs from its Berlin plant, with prices starting around ₹21 lakh (approximately $25,000). While initial plans focus on imported vehicles, local production may be considered if sales volumes justify the investment.",

C'è solo un 4 stelle su 5 Foto di: NHTSA Di: Iulian Dnistran Tradotto da: Riccardo Ciriaco 19 Febbraio alle 18:00 Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Condividi A più di un anno dall'inizio delle consegne (datato novembre 2023), il Tesla Cybertruck riceve finalmente una valutazione di sicurezza in caso di incidente. Il risultato? Cinque stelle, sia in generale che nella maggior parte delle singole categorie. A dare i voti è la National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) degli Stati Uniti, che sottopone diversi esemplari 2024 del pick-up elettrico ai crash test del New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). Urto frontale: 5 su 5 Cominciamo col test d'urto frontale, che simula una collisione - appunto frontale - tra veicoli simili attraverso l'impatto del veicolo di prova con una barriera piatta e rigida alla velocità di 35 miglia all'ora (56,3 km/h). In questo test, la NHTSA assegna valutazioni di sicurezza da cinque stelle per il conducente e quattro stelle per il passeggero. Il rapporto indica che gli airbag degli occupanti si attivano correttamente a eccezione di quelli per le ginocchia. La stessa Tesla conferma che gli airbag per le ginocchia sono progettati per non dispiegarsi in questo tipo di test. Fotogallery: Il crash test del Tesla Cybertruck 3 NHTSA Nel test d'urto laterale, il Cybertruck riceve un punteggio complessivo da cinque stelle. Va però specificato che questa categoria prevede due test individuali combinati. Ci sono il test della barriera laterale, che simula una collisione all'incrocio tra due veicoli, e il test del palo laterale, che simula la collisione di un veicolo con un oggetto fisso come un albero o un lampione. Nel test della barriera laterale, una barriera non rigida in movimento, inclinata di 27 gradi, urta col lato del guidatore a 38,5 miglia orarie (quasi 62 km/h). Nel test del palo laterale, il veicolo di prova è angolato di 75 gradi e si schianta con un palo rigido a 20 miglia orarie (32 km/h). In entrambi i test, il Cybertruck ottiene cinque stelle, sia per il sedile anteriore che per quello posteriore. Basso rischio ribaltamento Quattro stelle (su un massimo di cinque) sono infine il punteggio del test di resistenza al ribaltamento, che misura il rischio di ribaltamento dopo la perdita di controllo di un veicolo. La NHTSA rileva che il Cybertruck non si ribalta durante il test dinamico, anche se il rischio è del 12,4%. A oggi, tutti i veicoli Tesla testati dalla NHTSA hanno ricevuto una valutazione di sicurezza complessiva di cinque stelle.

C'è solo un 4 stelle su 5 Foto di: NHTSA Di: Iulian Dnistran Tradotto da: Riccardo Ciriaco 19 Febbraio alle 18:00 Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Condividi A più di un anno dall'inizio delle consegne (datato novembre 2023), il Tesla Cybertruck riceve finalmente una valutazione di sicurezza in caso di incidente. Il risultato? Cinque stelle, sia in generale che nella maggior parte delle singole categorie. A dare i voti è la National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) degli Stati Uniti, che sottopone diversi esemplari 2024 del pick-up elettrico ai crash test del New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). Urto frontale: 5 su 5 Cominciamo col test d'urto frontale, che simula una collisione - appunto frontale - tra veicoli simili attraverso l'impatto del veicolo di prova con una barriera piatta e rigida alla velocità di 35 miglia all'ora (56,3 km/h). In questo test, la NHTSA assegna valutazioni di sicurezza da cinque stelle per il conducente e quattro stelle per il passeggero. Il rapporto indica che gli airbag degli occupanti si attivano correttamente a eccezione di quelli per le ginocchia. La stessa Tesla conferma che gli airbag per le ginocchia sono progettati per non dispiegarsi in questo tipo di test. Fotogallery: Il crash test del Tesla Cybertruck 3 NHTSA Nel test d'urto laterale, il Cybertruck riceve un punteggio complessivo da cinque stelle. Va però specificato che questa categoria prevede due test individuali combinati. Ci sono il test della barriera laterale, che simula una collisione all'incrocio tra due veicoli, e il test del palo laterale, che simula la collisione di un veicolo con un oggetto fisso come un albero o un lampione. Nel test della barriera laterale, una barriera non rigida in movimento, inclinata di 27 gradi, urta col lato del guidatore a 38,5 miglia orarie (quasi 62 km/h). Nel test del palo laterale, il veicolo di prova è angolato di 75 gradi e si schianta con un palo rigido a 20 miglia orarie (32 km/h). In entrambi i test, il Cybertruck ottiene cinque stelle, sia per il sedile anteriore che per quello posteriore. Basso rischio ribaltamento Quattro stelle (su un massimo di cinque) sono infine il punteggio del test di resistenza al ribaltamento, che misura il rischio di ribaltamento dopo la perdita di controllo di un veicolo. La NHTSA rileva che il Cybertruck non si ribalta durante il test dinamico, anche se il rischio è del 12,4%. A oggi, tutti i veicoli Tesla testati dalla NHTSA hanno ricevuto una valutazione di sicurezza complessiva di cinque stelle.

C'è solo un 4 stelle su 5 Foto di: NHTSA Di: Iulian Dnistran Tradotto da: Riccardo Ciriaco 19 Febbraio alle 18:00 Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Condividi A più di un anno dall'inizio delle consegne (datato novembre 2023), il Tesla Cybertruck riceve finalmente una valutazione di sicurezza in caso di incidente. Il risultato? Cinque stelle, sia in generale che nella maggior parte delle singole categorie. A dare i voti è la National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) degli Stati Uniti, che sottopone diversi esemplari 2024 del pick-up elettrico ai crash test del New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). Urto frontale: 5 su 5 Cominciamo col test d'urto frontale, che simula una collisione - appunto frontale - tra veicoli simili attraverso l'impatto del veicolo di prova con una barriera piatta e rigida alla velocità di 35 miglia all'ora (56,3 km/h). In questo test, la NHTSA assegna valutazioni di sicurezza da cinque stelle per il conducente e quattro stelle per il passeggero. Il rapporto indica che gli airbag degli occupanti si attivano correttamente a eccezione di quelli per le ginocchia. La stessa Tesla conferma che gli airbag per le ginocchia sono progettati per non dispiegarsi in questo tipo di test. Fotogallery: Il crash test del Tesla Cybertruck 3 NHTSA Nel test d'urto laterale, il Cybertruck riceve un punteggio complessivo da cinque stelle. Va però specificato che questa categoria prevede due test individuali combinati. Ci sono il test della barriera laterale, che simula una collisione all'incrocio tra due veicoli, e il test del palo laterale, che simula la collisione di un veicolo con un oggetto fisso come un albero o un lampione. Nel test della barriera laterale, una barriera non rigida in movimento, inclinata di 27 gradi, urta col lato del guidatore a 38,5 miglia orarie (quasi 62 km/h). Nel test del palo laterale, il veicolo di prova è angolato di 75 gradi e si schianta con un palo rigido a 20 miglia orarie (32 km/h). In entrambi i test, il Cybertruck ottiene cinque stelle, sia per il sedile anteriore che per quello posteriore. Basso rischio ribaltamento Quattro stelle (su un massimo di cinque) sono infine il punteggio del test di resistenza al ribaltamento, che misura il rischio di ribaltamento dopo la perdita di controllo di un veicolo. La NHTSA rileva che il Cybertruck non si ribalta durante il test dinamico, anche se il rischio è del 12,4%. A oggi, tutti i veicoli Tesla testati dalla NHTSA hanno ricevuto una valutazione di sicurezza complessiva di cinque stelle.

The showrooms will be located in Aerocity, New Delhi, and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai, both high-traffic commercial zones. These will be standalone retail stores and not service outlets. Tesla's entry into India marks a significant step for the company, which had previously considered entering the Indian market in 2022 but postponed those plans due to regulatory barriers, high import duties, and infrastructure challenges. Overcoming these hurdles, Tesla refocused on establishing a retail presence in India last year, aiming to cultivate a local connection and support Indian consumers. Tesla's entry is expected to significantly impact India's EV industry by driving quicker EV growth through its advanced technology, revolutionary cars, and potential government support. The company's technology, competitive pricing, and possible government incentives could substantially increase the number of electric cars on Indian roads. This renewed effort gained momentum after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the United States. The discussions encompassed space, mobility, and technology, highlighting India's focus on promoting innovation and global partnerships. The showrooms in Delhi and Mumbai will span approximately 5,000 square feet. Tesla has also begun hiring for various positions in India, including store and customer relationship managers. Recent job listings indicate the company is seeking to fill 14 roles. Tesla is expected to introduce imported EVs from its Berlin plant, with prices starting around ₹21 lakh (approximately $25,000). While initial plans focus on imported vehicles, local production may be considered if sales volumes justify the investment.",

The showrooms will be located in Aerocity, New Delhi, and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai, both high-traffic commercial zones. These will be standalone retail stores and not service outlets. Tesla's entry into India marks a significant step for the company, which had previously considered entering the Indian market in 2022 but postponed those plans due to regulatory barriers, high import duties, and infrastructure challenges. Overcoming these hurdles, Tesla refocused on establishing a retail presence in India last year, aiming to cultivate a local connection and support Indian consumers. Tesla's entry is expected to significantly impact India's EV industry by driving quicker EV growth through its advanced technology, revolutionary cars, and potential government support. The company's technology, competitive pricing, and possible government incentives could substantially increase the number of electric cars on Indian roads. This renewed effort gained momentum after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the United States. The discussions encompassed space, mobility, and technology, highlighting India's focus on promoting innovation and global partnerships. The showrooms in Delhi and Mumbai will span approximately 5,000 square feet. Tesla has also begun hiring for various positions in India, including store and customer relationship managers. Recent job listings indicate the company is seeking to fill 14 roles. Tesla is expected to introduce imported EVs from its Berlin plant, with prices starting around ₹21 lakh (approximately $25,000). While initial plans focus on imported vehicles, local production may be considered if sales volumes justify the investment.",

Scroll Staff 21 minutes ago Read in App United States President Donald Trump. | Jim Watson/AFP United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that it would be “unfair” to his country if Elon Musk’s automotive company Tesla were to build a factory in India to bypass the country’s tariffs. In an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed that every other country in the world takes advantage of the United States through tariffs. “Now, if he [Musk] built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us,” Trump said. “It’s very unfair. ”The US president made the comments a week after he ordered a comprehensive plan to be developed to introduce “reciprocal tariffs” on foreign goods. Trump had similar comments on February 14 during a press conference alongside India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House. He claimed that India had been strong on tariffs, and that the “reciprocal measures” he was introducing were fair. Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla, has long questioned India’s policy of having import tariffs of around 100% on electric vehicles, which is aimed at protecting local automobile manufacturers. The billionaire businessman is also a senior advisor to Trump. In March, the Indian government introduced a new electric vehicle policy that reduces import taxes to 15% if a carmaker invests at least Rs 4,150 crore. The manufacturer will also have to achieve 50% domestic value addition within five years. Get the app ANDROID iOS We welcome your comments at letters@scroll. in.

Scroll Staff 21 minutes ago Read in App United States President Donald Trump. | Jim Watson/AFP United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that it would be “unfair” to his country if Elon Musk’s automotive company Tesla were to build a factory in India to bypass the country’s tariffs. In an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed that every other country in the world takes advantage of the United States through tariffs. “Now, if he [Musk] built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us,” Trump said. “It’s very unfair. ”The US president made the comments a week after he ordered a comprehensive plan to be developed to introduce “reciprocal tariffs” on foreign goods. Trump had similar comments on February 14 during a press conference alongside India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House. He claimed that India had been strong on tariffs, and that the “reciprocal measures” he was introducing were fair. Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla, has long questioned India’s policy of having import tariffs of around 100% on electric vehicles, which is aimed at protecting local automobile manufacturers. The billionaire businessman is also a senior advisor to Trump. In March, the Indian government introduced a new electric vehicle policy that reduces import taxes to 15% if a carmaker invests at least Rs 4,150 crore. The manufacturer will also have to achieve 50% domestic value addition within five years. Get the app ANDROID iOS We welcome your comments at letters@scroll. in.

Scroll Staff 21 minutes ago Read in App United States President Donald Trump. | Jim Watson/AFP United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that it would be “unfair” to his country if Elon Musk’s automotive company Tesla were to build a factory in India to bypass the country’s tariffs. In an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed that every other country in the world takes advantage of the United States through tariffs. “Now, if he [Musk] built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us,” Trump said. “It’s very unfair. ”The US president made the comments a week after he ordered a comprehensive plan to be developed to introduce “reciprocal tariffs” on foreign goods. Trump had similar comments on February 14 during a press conference alongside India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House. He claimed that India had been strong on tariffs, and that the “reciprocal measures” he was introducing were fair. Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla, has long questioned India’s policy of having import tariffs of around 100% on electric vehicles, which is aimed at protecting local automobile manufacturers. The billionaire businessman is also a senior advisor to Trump. In March, the Indian government introduced a new electric vehicle policy that reduces import taxes to 15% if a carmaker invests at least Rs 4,150 crore. The manufacturer will also have to achieve 50% domestic value addition within five years. Get the app ANDROID iOS We welcome your comments at letters@scroll. in.

Tesla India news resurfaced after the American EV maker posted 13 new jobs posts in Mumbai. Tesla has reportedly started talking with leaders in the Indian automotive market as it prepares to set up shop in the country. Tata Motors is one of the companies Tesla is conversing with, leading some to believe that the American automaker is hunting for talent from the Indian car maker. “Tesla has also begun making calls to top executives at companies like Tata Motors, which is a leader in the EV manufacturing space in India,” noted a person familiar with the matter. https://t. co/ZWuMEEk7L0— TESLARATI (@Teslarati) February 18, 2025 Senior Tesla executive Prashanth Menon is expected to take a significant role in the company’s operations in India. He has reportedly returned to India. In 2021, Tesla appointed Menon its Director of Operations in India. However, in 2022, he was reassigned to the Netherlands when Tesla’s plans for India seemed to reach a roadblock. Tesla is reportedly opening its first two stores in India. The company has allegedly decided to build a store in the Aerocity area near New Delhi International Airport. Another Tesla store is expected to open in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex shopping area. Insiders commented that Tesla is also scouting sites for an EV manufacturing plant. Since Tesla has already established an office in Prune, most people speculate that the company will establish a factory in Maharashtra. “The company has been keen on Maharashtra because it already has an office in Pune, and this would be a natural extension of its operations, considering it has a lot of existing suppliers in the state, too,” noted an insider.

Nelson believes Tesla’s robotaxi business will drive the stock to higher heights. “We remain bullish on Tesla, Inc. because we’re optimistic as far as regulatory approvals and getting a regulatory framework related to autonomous driving in the United States. “I think that will come sooner rather than later. It became clear after Tesla Robotaxi Day back in October that the story was all about autonomous driving going forward, and you look at the value of the company in our view, it’s still trading at a fraction of the market opportunity here, which we estimate to be, you know, north of $5 trillion, if you look at the global autonomous driving opportunity. So, you know, we’re buyers on this dip that we’ve seen in the stock this week,” commented Nelson while on Schwab Network.

Last month, Morgan Stanely forecasted an $800 bull case scenario for Tesla based on the potential of its robotaxi business. Tesla expects to launch robotaxi–with unsupervised self-driving– paid services in Austin by June 2025. During the Full Year and Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Elon Musk predicted that robotaxi services would be available across multiple cities in the United States by the end of this year. However, not all Tesla analysts believe the robotaxi fleet will benefit the company’s business. Gary Black predicts that less than 50% of Tesla owners will join the fleet. He argued that Tesla owners would be against including a personal vehicle in a publicly-used fleet. The Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

S. President Donald Trump. Elon Musk is one of the most visible supporters of the U. S. President, thanks to his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trouble in Toronto: As per a CBC report, Toronto deputy mayor Mike Colle has stated that he wants to drive Tesla out of town due to Musk’s affiliation with Donald Trump. Colle has even written a letter to Oxford Properties asking them to cancel Tesla’s lease at the Yorkdale Shopping Center. “People are really angry with anything to do with Tesla, and they’re also letting me know they’re not happy with the fact that there’s a Tesla retail outlet in my ward. I’m cordially asking the owners of Yorkdale Plaza, would you please consider terminating their lease or asking them to leave,” Colle noted, also stating that his letter is a “polite, aggressive ask. ”When asked about Tesla employees in the city who may lose their jobs if the EV maker is chased out of Toronto, Colle noted that “It’s unfortunate, but I’m more worried about the 500,000 Ontarians who are going to be thrown out on the street as a result of the Musk-Trump tariffs. ”Toronto mayor Olivia Chow has also put forward a motion to exclude Tesla’s electric vehicles from the city’s zero emissions grant program for taxi and limousine owners. The motion was passed by council last week. No violations from Tesla: City spokesperson Shane Gerard has confirmed that Tesla Canada has not violated any of Toronto’s bylaws. “Tesla Motors Canada ULC. , operating as Tesla Motors, currently holds five active public garage licenses. Enforcement, including potential license revocation, pertains mostly to businesses operating without this license or not complying with license conditions. The city is not aware of any breaches of Chapter 545 by Tesla Motors,” Gerard noted. A critic speaks out: Toronto councilor James Pasternak has expressed his criticism of the city’s anti-Tesla proposals. As per the official, it does not make sense to specifically target Tesla Canada workers due to the country’s trade dispute with the United States. “We’re running down a very risky course here when we’re chasing out businesses, trying to close down businesses, in which a distant CEO is making comments we find offensive. I don’t think we should be causing people to lose their jobs,” Pasternak noted. The councilor also noted that Toronto will likely not be able to drive Tesla out of the city by force since the company is not doing anything illegal. Tesla is not violating any bylaws either. Pasternak also stated that it should be up to consumers to decide whether they would purchase products from controversial companies. He also warned about potential legal issues if Toronto punishes a company that has technically done nothing wrong. Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

Nelson believes Tesla’s robotaxi business will drive the stock to higher heights. “We remain bullish on Tesla, Inc. because we’re optimistic as far as regulatory approvals and getting a regulatory framework related to autonomous driving in the United States. “I think that will come sooner rather than later. It became clear after Tesla Robotaxi Day back in October that the story was all about autonomous driving going forward, and you look at the value of the company in our view, it’s still trading at a fraction of the market opportunity here, which we estimate to be, you know, north of $5 trillion, if you look at the global autonomous driving opportunity. So, you know, we’re buyers on this dip that we’ve seen in the stock this week,” commented Nelson while on Schwab Network.

Last month, Morgan Stanely forecasted an $800 bull case scenario for Tesla based on the potential of its robotaxi business. Tesla expects to launch robotaxi–with unsupervised self-driving– paid services in Austin by June 2025. During the Full Year and Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Elon Musk predicted that robotaxi services would be available across multiple cities in the United States by the end of this year. However, not all Tesla analysts believe the robotaxi fleet will benefit the company’s business. Gary Black predicts that less than 50% of Tesla owners will join the fleet. He argued that Tesla owners would be against including a personal vehicle in a publicly-used fleet. The Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

Tesla India news resurfaced after the American EV maker posted 13 new jobs posts in Mumbai. Tesla has reportedly started talking with leaders in the Indian automotive market as it prepares to set up shop in the country. Tata Motors is one of the companies Tesla is conversing with, leading some to believe that the American automaker is hunting for talent from the Indian car maker. “Tesla has also begun making calls to top executives at companies like Tata Motors, which is a leader in the EV manufacturing space in India,” noted a person familiar with the matter. https://t. co/ZWuMEEk7L0— TESLARATI (@Teslarati) February 18, 2025 Senior Tesla executive Prashanth Menon is expected to take a significant role in the company’s operations in India. He has reportedly returned to India. In 2021, Tesla appointed Menon its Director of Operations in India. However, in 2022, he was reassigned to the Netherlands when Tesla’s plans for India seemed to reach a roadblock. Tesla is reportedly opening its first two stores in India. The company has allegedly decided to build a store in the Aerocity area near New Delhi International Airport. Another Tesla store is expected to open in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex shopping area. Insiders commented that Tesla is also scouting sites for an EV manufacturing plant. Since Tesla has already established an office in Prune, most people speculate that the company will establish a factory in Maharashtra. “The company has been keen on Maharashtra because it already has an office in Pune, and this would be a natural extension of its operations, considering it has a lot of existing suppliers in the state, too,” noted an insider.

S. President Donald Trump. Elon Musk is one of the most visible supporters of the U. S. President, thanks to his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trouble in Toronto: As per a CBC report, Toronto deputy mayor Mike Colle has stated that he wants to drive Tesla out of town due to Musk’s affiliation with Donald Trump. Colle has even written a letter to Oxford Properties asking them to cancel Tesla’s lease at the Yorkdale Shopping Center. “People are really angry with anything to do with Tesla, and they’re also letting me know they’re not happy with the fact that there’s a Tesla retail outlet in my ward. I’m cordially asking the owners of Yorkdale Plaza, would you please consider terminating their lease or asking them to leave,” Colle noted, also stating that his letter is a “polite, aggressive ask. ”When asked about Tesla employees in the city who may lose their jobs if the EV maker is chased out of Toronto, Colle noted that “It’s unfortunate, but I’m more worried about the 500,000 Ontarians who are going to be thrown out on the street as a result of the Musk-Trump tariffs. ”Toronto mayor Olivia Chow has also put forward a motion to exclude Tesla’s electric vehicles from the city’s zero emissions grant program for taxi and limousine owners. The motion was passed by council last week. No violations from Tesla: City spokesperson Shane Gerard has confirmed that Tesla Canada has not violated any of Toronto’s bylaws. “Tesla Motors Canada ULC. , operating as Tesla Motors, currently holds five active public garage licenses. Enforcement, including potential license revocation, pertains mostly to businesses operating without this license or not complying with license conditions. The city is not aware of any breaches of Chapter 545 by Tesla Motors,” Gerard noted. A critic speaks out: Toronto councilor James Pasternak has expressed his criticism of the city’s anti-Tesla proposals. As per the official, it does not make sense to specifically target Tesla Canada workers due to the country’s trade dispute with the United States. “We’re running down a very risky course here when we’re chasing out businesses, trying to close down businesses, in which a distant CEO is making comments we find offensive. I don’t think we should be causing people to lose their jobs,” Pasternak noted. The councilor also noted that Toronto will likely not be able to drive Tesla out of the city by force since the company is not doing anything illegal. Tesla is not violating any bylaws either. Pasternak also stated that it should be up to consumers to decide whether they would purchase products from controversial companies. He also warned about potential legal issues if Toronto punishes a company that has technically done nothing wrong. Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

S. President Donald Trump. Elon Musk is one of the most visible supporters of the U. S. President, thanks to his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trouble in Toronto: As per a CBC report, Toronto deputy mayor Mike Colle has stated that he wants to drive Tesla out of town due to Musk’s affiliation with Donald Trump. Colle has even written a letter to Oxford Properties asking them to cancel Tesla’s lease at the Yorkdale Shopping Center. “People are really angry with anything to do with Tesla, and they’re also letting me know they’re not happy with the fact that there’s a Tesla retail outlet in my ward. I’m cordially asking the owners of Yorkdale Plaza, would you please consider terminating their lease or asking them to leave,” Colle noted, also stating that his letter is a “polite, aggressive ask. ”When asked about Tesla employees in the city who may lose their jobs if the EV maker is chased out of Toronto, Colle noted that “It’s unfortunate, but I’m more worried about the 500,000 Ontarians who are going to be thrown out on the street as a result of the Musk-Trump tariffs. ”Toronto mayor Olivia Chow has also put forward a motion to exclude Tesla’s electric vehicles from the city’s zero emissions grant program for taxi and limousine owners. The motion was passed by council last week. No violations from Tesla: City spokesperson Shane Gerard has confirmed that Tesla Canada has not violated any of Toronto’s bylaws. “Tesla Motors Canada ULC. , operating as Tesla Motors, currently holds five active public garage licenses. Enforcement, including potential license revocation, pertains mostly to businesses operating without this license or not complying with license conditions. The city is not aware of any breaches of Chapter 545 by Tesla Motors,” Gerard noted. A critic speaks out: Toronto councilor James Pasternak has expressed his criticism of the city’s anti-Tesla proposals. As per the official, it does not make sense to specifically target Tesla Canada workers due to the country’s trade dispute with the United States. “We’re running down a very risky course here when we’re chasing out businesses, trying to close down businesses, in which a distant CEO is making comments we find offensive. I don’t think we should be causing people to lose their jobs,” Pasternak noted. The councilor also noted that Toronto will likely not be able to drive Tesla out of the city by force since the company is not doing anything illegal. Tesla is not violating any bylaws either. Pasternak also stated that it should be up to consumers to decide whether they would purchase products from controversial companies. He also warned about potential legal issues if Toronto punishes a company that has technically done nothing wrong. Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

S. President Donald Trump. Elon Musk is one of the most visible supporters of the U. S. President, thanks to his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trouble in Toronto: As per a CBC report, Toronto deputy mayor Mike Colle has stated that he wants to drive Tesla out of town due to Musk’s affiliation with Donald Trump. Colle has even written a letter to Oxford Properties asking them to cancel Tesla’s lease at the Yorkdale Shopping Center. “People are really angry with anything to do with Tesla, and they’re also letting me know they’re not happy with the fact that there’s a Tesla retail outlet in my ward. I’m cordially asking the owners of Yorkdale Plaza, would you please consider terminating their lease or asking them to leave,” Colle noted, also stating that his letter is a “polite, aggressive ask. ”When asked about Tesla employees in the city who may lose their jobs if the EV maker is chased out of Toronto, Colle noted that “It’s unfortunate, but I’m more worried about the 500,000 Ontarians who are going to be thrown out on the street as a result of the Musk-Trump tariffs. ”Toronto mayor Olivia Chow has also put forward a motion to exclude Tesla’s electric vehicles from the city’s zero emissions grant program for taxi and limousine owners. The motion was passed by council last week. No violations from Tesla: City spokesperson Shane Gerard has confirmed that Tesla Canada has not violated any of Toronto’s bylaws. “Tesla Motors Canada ULC. , operating as Tesla Motors, currently holds five active public garage licenses. Enforcement, including potential license revocation, pertains mostly to businesses operating without this license or not complying with license conditions. The city is not aware of any breaches of Chapter 545 by Tesla Motors,” Gerard noted. A critic speaks out: Toronto councilor James Pasternak has expressed his criticism of the city’s anti-Tesla proposals. As per the official, it does not make sense to specifically target Tesla Canada workers due to the country’s trade dispute with the United States. “We’re running down a very risky course here when we’re chasing out businesses, trying to close down businesses, in which a distant CEO is making comments we find offensive. I don’t think we should be causing people to lose their jobs,” Pasternak noted. The councilor also noted that Toronto will likely not be able to drive Tesla out of the city by force since the company is not doing anything illegal. Tesla is not violating any bylaws either. Pasternak also stated that it should be up to consumers to decide whether they would purchase products from controversial companies. He also warned about potential legal issues if Toronto punishes a company that has technically done nothing wrong. Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

Nelson believes Tesla’s robotaxi business will drive the stock to higher heights. “We remain bullish on Tesla, Inc. because we’re optimistic as far as regulatory approvals and getting a regulatory framework related to autonomous driving in the United States. “I think that will come sooner rather than later. It became clear after Tesla Robotaxi Day back in October that the story was all about autonomous driving going forward, and you look at the value of the company in our view, it’s still trading at a fraction of the market opportunity here, which we estimate to be, you know, north of $5 trillion, if you look at the global autonomous driving opportunity. So, you know, we’re buyers on this dip that we’ve seen in the stock this week,” commented Nelson while on Schwab Network.

Last month, Morgan Stanely forecasted an $800 bull case scenario for Tesla based on the potential of its robotaxi business. Tesla expects to launch robotaxi–with unsupervised self-driving– paid services in Austin by June 2025. During the Full Year and Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Elon Musk predicted that robotaxi services would be available across multiple cities in the United States by the end of this year. However, not all Tesla analysts believe the robotaxi fleet will benefit the company’s business. Gary Black predicts that less than 50% of Tesla owners will join the fleet. He argued that Tesla owners would be against including a personal vehicle in a publicly-used fleet. The Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

Tesla India news resurfaced after the American EV maker posted 13 new jobs posts in Mumbai. Tesla has reportedly started talking with leaders in the Indian automotive market as it prepares to set up shop in the country. Tata Motors is one of the companies Tesla is conversing with, leading some to believe that the American automaker is hunting for talent from the Indian car maker. “Tesla has also begun making calls to top executives at companies like Tata Motors, which is a leader in the EV manufacturing space in India,” noted a person familiar with the matter. https://t. co/ZWuMEEk7L0— TESLARATI (@Teslarati) February 18, 2025 Senior Tesla executive Prashanth Menon is expected to take a significant role in the company’s operations in India. He has reportedly returned to India. In 2021, Tesla appointed Menon its Director of Operations in India. However, in 2022, he was reassigned to the Netherlands when Tesla’s plans for India seemed to reach a roadblock. Tesla is reportedly opening its first two stores in India. The company has allegedly decided to build a store in the Aerocity area near New Delhi International Airport. Another Tesla store is expected to open in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex shopping area. Insiders commented that Tesla is also scouting sites for an EV manufacturing plant. Since Tesla has already established an office in Prune, most people speculate that the company will establish a factory in Maharashtra. “The company has been keen on Maharashtra because it already has an office in Pune, and this would be a natural extension of its operations, considering it has a lot of existing suppliers in the state, too,” noted an insider.

Nelson believes Tesla’s robotaxi business will drive the stock to higher heights. “We remain bullish on Tesla, Inc. because we’re optimistic as far as regulatory approvals and getting a regulatory framework related to autonomous driving in the United States. “I think that will come sooner rather than later. It became clear after Tesla Robotaxi Day back in October that the story was all about autonomous driving going forward, and you look at the value of the company in our view, it’s still trading at a fraction of the market opportunity here, which we estimate to be, you know, north of $5 trillion, if you look at the global autonomous driving opportunity. So, you know, we’re buyers on this dip that we’ve seen in the stock this week,” commented Nelson while on Schwab Network.

Last month, Morgan Stanely forecasted an $800 bull case scenario for Tesla based on the potential of its robotaxi business. Tesla expects to launch robotaxi–with unsupervised self-driving– paid services in Austin by June 2025. During the Full Year and Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Elon Musk predicted that robotaxi services would be available across multiple cities in the United States by the end of this year. However, not all Tesla analysts believe the robotaxi fleet will benefit the company’s business. Gary Black predicts that less than 50% of Tesla owners will join the fleet. He argued that Tesla owners would be against including a personal vehicle in a publicly-used fleet. The Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

Tesla India news resurfaced after the American EV maker posted 13 new jobs posts in Mumbai. Tesla has reportedly started talking with leaders in the Indian automotive market as it prepares to set up shop in the country. Tata Motors is one of the companies Tesla is conversing with, leading some to believe that the American automaker is hunting for talent from the Indian car maker. “Tesla has also begun making calls to top executives at companies like Tata Motors, which is a leader in the EV manufacturing space in India,” noted a person familiar with the matter. https://t. co/ZWuMEEk7L0— TESLARATI (@Teslarati) February 18, 2025 Senior Tesla executive Prashanth Menon is expected to take a significant role in the company’s operations in India. He has reportedly returned to India. In 2021, Tesla appointed Menon its Director of Operations in India. However, in 2022, he was reassigned to the Netherlands when Tesla’s plans for India seemed to reach a roadblock. Tesla is reportedly opening its first two stores in India. The company has allegedly decided to build a store in the Aerocity area near New Delhi International Airport. Another Tesla store is expected to open in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex shopping area. Insiders commented that Tesla is also scouting sites for an EV manufacturing plant. Since Tesla has already established an office in Prune, most people speculate that the company will establish a factory in Maharashtra. “The company has been keen on Maharashtra because it already has an office in Pune, and this would be a natural extension of its operations, considering it has a lot of existing suppliers in the state, too,” noted an insider.

The notification came through the owner’s phone while he was at work, meaning he couldn’t easily go and see what was going on for himself. The camera showed a random guy standing next to his Tesla and pulling the charger out. How did the owner react? Well, probably not in the way you might expect. DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie Someone was trying to unplug the Tesla The camera revealed someone attempting to unplug the EV as if they were pulling a prank on the owner. That kind of prank would ensure that when the owner returned, the Tesla wouldn’t be fully charged. Naturally, the owner of this Tesla wasn’t going to have any of it. So, while the random man struggled to remove the charger, the owner pulled out the Tesla app on their phone to have some fun. Watch this video on YouTube The YouTuber WhamBaamTeslacam began to play ‘fart’ noises down the app, which then play via speakers on the car. You could use this function to talk directly to the man by the Tesla, but this owner wanted to have a bit more fun. The owner of the car pressed the amusing button 10-15 times. And the stranger’s reaction was exactly as he’d hoped it would be. The random motorist had got the wrong Model 3 As it turned out, there was no foul play. He was also the owner of a Model 3 and somehow got confused between his car and the one that was currently playing fart noises. WhamBaamTeslacam YouTube Channel Upon realizing the error of his ways, the random man went back to the car he had unplugged and placed the charger back into the socket. He made sure it was charging once again before walking away back to his own Tesla. # Tags - EV, Tesla, Tesla Model 3 # Tags - EV, Tesla, Tesla Model 3 Henry Kelsall Henry is a content writer with nearly ten years experience, having written for various publications since 2017.

The notification came through the owner’s phone while he was at work, meaning he couldn’t easily go and see what was going on for himself. The camera showed a random guy standing next to his Tesla and pulling the charger out. How did the owner react? Well, probably not in the way you might expect. DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie Someone was trying to unplug the Tesla The camera revealed someone attempting to unplug the EV as if they were pulling a prank on the owner. That kind of prank would ensure that when the owner returned, the Tesla wouldn’t be fully charged. Naturally, the owner of this Tesla wasn’t going to have any of it. So, while the random man struggled to remove the charger, the owner pulled out the Tesla app on their phone to have some fun. Watch this video on YouTube The YouTuber WhamBaamTeslacam began to play ‘fart’ noises down the app, which then play via speakers on the car. You could use this function to talk directly to the man by the Tesla, but this owner wanted to have a bit more fun. The owner of the car pressed the amusing button 10-15 times. And the stranger’s reaction was exactly as he’d hoped it would be. The random motorist had got the wrong Model 3 As it turned out, there was no foul play. He was also the owner of a Model 3 and somehow got confused between his car and the one that was currently playing fart noises. WhamBaamTeslacam YouTube Channel Upon realizing the error of his ways, the random man went back to the car he had unplugged and placed the charger back into the socket. He made sure it was charging once again before walking away back to his own Tesla. # Tags - EV, Tesla, Tesla Model 3 # Tags - EV, Tesla, Tesla Model 3 Henry Kelsall Henry is a content writer with nearly ten years experience, having written for various publications since 2017.

The notification came through the owner’s phone while he was at work, meaning he couldn’t easily go and see what was going on for himself. The camera showed a random guy standing next to his Tesla and pulling the charger out. How did the owner react? Well, probably not in the way you might expect. DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie Someone was trying to unplug the Tesla The camera revealed someone attempting to unplug the EV as if they were pulling a prank on the owner. That kind of prank would ensure that when the owner returned, the Tesla wouldn’t be fully charged. Naturally, the owner of this Tesla wasn’t going to have any of it. So, while the random man struggled to remove the charger, the owner pulled out the Tesla app on their phone to have some fun. Watch this video on YouTube The YouTuber WhamBaamTeslacam began to play ‘fart’ noises down the app, which then play via speakers on the car. You could use this function to talk directly to the man by the Tesla, but this owner wanted to have a bit more fun. The owner of the car pressed the amusing button 10-15 times. And the stranger’s reaction was exactly as he’d hoped it would be. The random motorist had got the wrong Model 3 As it turned out, there was no foul play. He was also the owner of a Model 3 and somehow got confused between his car and the one that was currently playing fart noises. WhamBaamTeslacam YouTube Channel Upon realizing the error of his ways, the random man went back to the car he had unplugged and placed the charger back into the socket. He made sure it was charging once again before walking away back to his own Tesla. # Tags - EV, Tesla, Tesla Model 3 # Tags - EV, Tesla, Tesla Model 3 Henry Kelsall Henry is a content writer with nearly ten years experience, having written for various publications since 2017.
