In a video posted to Instagram on Friday, the “Soak Up the Sun” singer waved goodbye to her Tesla as it was being towed away. In the caption, she explained that she had sold the vehicle, and donated the money to National Public Radio, which she said is “under threat by President Musk. ” Get Sheryl Crow Tickets Here Crow — who was once a proud Tesla owner — also wrote, “My parents always said… you are who you hang out with. There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla. ” Related Video With her donation to NPR, she expressed a hope that “the truth will continue to find its way to those willing to know the truth. ” In the comments, Crow received support from several of her musician friends, including Margo Price, who wrote “Love to see it,” and Kacey Musgraves, who left two separate comments reading “Sheryl Queen” and “Sheryl CrowN. ” Advertisement The move comes in the wake of Musk’s actions in Donald Trump’s second administration, including targeting recipients of government subsidies. Earlier this month, he tweeted “Defund NPR. It should survive on its own. ” On paper, NPR receives only 1% of its funding from the federal government directly, but in reality, a large portion of its income relies on government support by way of the funding provided to local stations, who then purchase programming produced by NPR. According to The Hill, $90 million of NPR’s $309 million revenue in 2021 came from these programming contracts, with an additional $121 million coming from corporate sponsorships. Meanwhile, Crow has a number of upcoming tour dates, including headlining shows and sets on the 2025 iteration of Willie Nelson’s Outlaw Music Festival tour. Get tickets here. Earlier this month, Crow supported rising artists with an intimate concert showcase in Massachusetts.

In a video posted to Instagram on Friday, the “Soak Up the Sun” singer waved goodbye to her Tesla as it was being towed away.

Earlier this month, he tweeted “Defund NPR. It should survive on its own. ” On paper, NPR receives only 1% of its funding from the federal government directly, but in reality, a large portion of its income relies on government support by way of the funding provided to local stations, who then purchase programming produced by NPR. According to The Hill, $90 million of NPR’s $309 million revenue in 2021 came from these programming contracts, with an additional $121 million coming from corporate sponsorships. Meanwhile, Crow has a number of upcoming tour dates, including headlining shows and sets on the 2025 iteration of Willie Nelson’s Outlaw Music Festival tour. Get tickets here. Earlier this month, Crow supported rising artists with an intimate concert showcase in Massachusetts.

In a video posted to Instagram on Friday, the “Soak Up the Sun” singer waved goodbye to her Tesla as it was being towed away.

Earlier this month, he tweeted “Defund NPR. It should survive on its own. ” On paper, NPR receives only 1% of its funding from the federal government directly, but in reality, a large portion of its income relies on government support by way of the funding provided to local stations, who then purchase programming produced by NPR. According to The Hill, $90 million of NPR’s $309 million revenue in 2021 came from these programming contracts, with an additional $121 million coming from corporate sponsorships. Meanwhile, Crow has a number of upcoming tour dates, including headlining shows and sets on the 2025 iteration of Willie Nelson’s Outlaw Music Festival tour. Get tickets here. Earlier this month, Crow supported rising artists with an intimate concert showcase in Massachusetts.

In a video posted to Instagram on Friday, the “Soak Up the Sun” singer waved goodbye to her Tesla as it was being towed away.

Earlier this month, he tweeted “Defund NPR. It should survive on its own. ” On paper, NPR receives only 1% of its funding from the federal government directly, but in reality, a large portion of its income relies on government support by way of the funding provided to local stations, who then purchase programming produced by NPR. According to The Hill, $90 million of NPR’s $309 million revenue in 2021 came from these programming contracts, with an additional $121 million coming from corporate sponsorships. Meanwhile, Crow has a number of upcoming tour dates, including headlining shows and sets on the 2025 iteration of Willie Nelson’s Outlaw Music Festival tour. Get tickets here. Earlier this month, Crow supported rising artists with an intimate concert showcase in Massachusetts.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) Sheryl Crow is done with her Tesla. In a social media post, the singer waves goodbye to the electric vehicle made by Elon Musk's company, reports USA Today. \"My parents always said . . . you are who you hang out with,\" Crow wrote. \"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla. \" Crow added she is donating money from the move to NPR, which she said is \"under threat by President Musk. \" Musk has called for the federal government to \"defund\" the outlet, which he says has a liberal bias, though the Hill notes that federal funding makes up a small portion of its financing. The Trump administration, through the Federal Communications Commission, already has launched an investigation into both NPR and PBS. (The IRS is expected to lay off thousands of employees amid tax season as part of Musk's governmental cost-cutting. ) Report an error Vote 9 comments Back to my spot Next Story My Take on This Story Show results 14% Hilarious 0% Intriguing 0% Depressing 41% Brilliant 3% Scary 41% Ridiculous The Latest News Feb 15, 2025 8:55 AM CST Panda Frenzy Takes Over Hong Kong Feb 15, 2025 8:43 AM CST Jannik Sinner Accepts 3-Month Ban Feb 14, 2025 11:39 AM CST A Polar Vortex Is Coming.

By Chase DiBenedetto on February 16, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Dozens of Tesla showrooms were taken over by small protest groups rallying against owner Elon Musk. Credit: Jason Redmond / Contributor / AFP via Getty Images A movement to strike back against Tesla CEO and \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) leader Elon Musk left social media and took to the streets this weekend. Groups of protesters at Tesla showrooms across the country sported signs with messages like, \"Stop the broligarchy,\" \"Burn a Tesla, save democracy,\" and \"DOGE is a criminal enterprise,\" encouraging potential Tesla buyers to take their money elsewhere. Referred to as the #TeslaTakeover, the protests were organized by a small-but-mighty army of Bluesky users supported by Seattle-based activist group the Troublemakers and direct action The Disruption Project. Many of the events were posted to Action Network, which by Saturday rose to 50 planned protests nationwide, including small town hits and several in California and New York, Washington D. C. , Ohio, and even Canada. \"Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines. Hurting Tesla is stopping Musk. Stopping Musk will help save lives and our democracy,\" the page reads. The #TeslaTakeover events, set for Feb. 15, generated rallies of varying sizes — from handfuls of protesters to large crowds of dozens of people chanting and parading signs — all with the same message: Musk is doing something categorically wrong.

Globally, Tesla owners and onlookers have been hitting back at Elon Musk's quick encroachment into the federal government, spurred on by the wider accusation that the SpaceX owner is associating with alt-right figures. Earlier this year, protests broke out at the German Die Welt Economic Summit, at which Musk was set to virtually appear, following Musk's decision to back a German far-right political party.

On Feb. 13, 14 state attorney generals filed a lawsuit against Musk, challenging the legality of DOGE's actions and asking for the court to bar Musk from issuing orders to bodies outside of the executive branch or overseeing the disbursement of federal funds.

By Chase DiBenedetto on February 16, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Dozens of Tesla showrooms were taken over by small protest groups rallying against owner Elon Musk. Credit: Jason Redmond / Contributor / AFP via Getty Images A movement to strike back against Tesla CEO and \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) leader Elon Musk left social media and took to the streets this weekend. Groups of protesters at Tesla showrooms across the country sported signs with messages like, \"Stop the broligarchy,\" \"Burn a Tesla, save democracy,\" and \"DOGE is a criminal enterprise,\" encouraging potential Tesla buyers to take their money elsewhere. Referred to as the #TeslaTakeover, the protests were organized by a small-but-mighty army of Bluesky users supported by Seattle-based activist group the Troublemakers and direct action The Disruption Project. Many of the events were posted to Action Network, which by Saturday rose to 50 planned protests nationwide, including small town hits and several in California and New York, Washington D. C. , Ohio, and even Canada. \"Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines. Hurting Tesla is stopping Musk. Stopping Musk will help save lives and our democracy,\" the page reads. The #TeslaTakeover events, set for Feb. 15, generated rallies of varying sizes — from handfuls of protesters to large crowds of dozens of people chanting and parading signs — all with the same message: Musk is doing something categorically wrong.

Globally, Tesla owners and onlookers have been hitting back at Elon Musk's quick encroachment into the federal government, spurred on by the wider accusation that the SpaceX owner is associating with alt-right figures. Earlier this year, protests broke out at the German Die Welt Economic Summit, at which Musk was set to virtually appear, following Musk's decision to back a German far-right political party.

On Feb. 13, 14 state attorney generals filed a lawsuit against Musk, challenging the legality of DOGE's actions and asking for the court to bar Musk from issuing orders to bodies outside of the executive branch or overseeing the disbursement of federal funds.

By Chase DiBenedetto on February 16, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Dozens of Tesla showrooms were taken over by small protest groups rallying against owner Elon Musk. Credit: Jason Redmond / Contributor / AFP via Getty Images A movement to strike back against Tesla CEO and \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) leader Elon Musk left social media and took to the streets this weekend. Groups of protesters at Tesla showrooms across the country sported signs with messages like, \"Stop the broligarchy,\" \"Burn a Tesla, save democracy,\" and \"DOGE is a criminal enterprise,\" encouraging potential Tesla buyers to take their money elsewhere. Referred to as the #TeslaTakeover, the protests were organized by a small-but-mighty army of Bluesky users supported by Seattle-based activist group the Troublemakers and direct action The Disruption Project. Many of the events were posted to Action Network, which by Saturday rose to 50 planned protests nationwide, including small town hits and several in California and New York, Washington D. C. , Ohio, and even Canada. \"Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines. Hurting Tesla is stopping Musk. Stopping Musk will help save lives and our democracy,\" the page reads. The #TeslaTakeover events, set for Feb. 15, generated rallies of varying sizes — from handfuls of protesters to large crowds of dozens of people chanting and parading signs — all with the same message: Musk is doing something categorically wrong.

Globally, Tesla owners and onlookers have been hitting back at Elon Musk's quick encroachment into the federal government, spurred on by the wider accusation that the SpaceX owner is associating with alt-right figures. Earlier this year, protests broke out at the German Die Welt Economic Summit, at which Musk was set to virtually appear, following Musk's decision to back a German far-right political party.

On Feb. 13, 14 state attorney generals filed a lawsuit against Musk, challenging the legality of DOGE's actions and asking for the court to bar Musk from issuing orders to bodies outside of the executive branch or overseeing the disbursement of federal funds.

If It Makes You Happy: Sheryl Crow Wouldn't 'Hang Out' With Her Tesla, but DID Hang Out With THESE Guys Amy Curtis | 4:00 PM on February 16, 2025 Advertisement imgflip Yesterday, we told you how singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow got rid of her Tesla because, as her parents told her, 'you are who you hang out with. ' We had no idea Elon Musk himself was driving Crow around; it's the only way she was 'hanging out' with him, because owning a car from his company is not the same as fraternizing with someone. Advertisement But since Crow opened up that door, let's walk in and see who she actually hung around with. “You are who you hang out with” - Sheryl Crow pic. twitter. com/m8DpDoC134— Gunther Eagleman™ (@GuntherEagleman) February 15, 2025Oh. Elon Musk is just too much. But Harvey Weinstein, who is currently serving a 23-year sentence for sex crimes, is fine. To the best of Google's knowledge, Crow never publicly denounced Weinstein. But wait! There's more:pic. twitter. com/jPWCBqMyjr— ClamSat (@clamsat_bioptic) February 15, 2025Diddy's facing charges for several things, including sex trafficking.

The arrogance of Hollywood celebs is astounding. They think their fame qualifies them to dictate policy. — Puke Stew (@PukeStew) February 15, 2025They sure do. Think she might need to be reminded, Cars are not people. you can hang out in a car but not with a car because its not alive. — Dirtroadphilosopher (@Dirtroadphil) February 15, 2025 Recommended Wow.

She said one square of toilet paper per trip.

Elon Musk is just too much. But Harvey Weinstein, who is currently serving a 23-year sentence for sex crimes, is fine. To the best of Google's knowledge, Crow never publicly denounced Weinstein.

Then the mechanic is left speechless after seeing this ‘Tesla build quality is SO bad. ’ Jack Alban Posted on February 16 2025 3:00 pm CST @concept3performance/TikTok Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock Nawin27/ShutterStock (Licensed) An incredulous auto service technician couldn’t believe the condition of a Tesla Model 3 that rolled into the shop. The Concept 3 Performance TikTok account (@concept3performance) posted a viral clip that’s accrued over 202,000 views as of Sunday. Featured Video In it, they displayed a glaring issue with a portion of the car’s power train. One that left the lead tech speechless and several commenters decrying Tesla’s build quality. ‘How…is he driving?’“So a 2022 Tesla Model 3 recently changed his brakes and he found this,” the auto tech says to her co-worker. Which prompts him to ask, “How the [expletive] is he driving?” Advertisement Next, the video cuts to footage of a mechanical component of the Tesla vehicle. There appears to be a separation of a U-shaped metallic arm from another portion of the vehicle. Even upon first glance, it seems something is very wrong with the Tesla’s machinery. As the video progresses, it appears that the driver was riding around with a severely damaged control arm. Afterward, the camera pans up towards the auto tech who is still baffled by the damage. “How has he not killed anybody or himself?” he wonders aloud. “It’s a 2022. I don’t even wanna know if he’s changing the brake on a…”A litany of various math equations a la The Hangover begin populating the screen.

That’s a rear upper, no?” Advertisement One of the other techs assesses the damage. “I think that’s like lower caster. ”Again, the shop owner expresses just how shocked he is at the driver’s decision to hit the road. “That’s how he’s driving…very dangerous…I highly recommend don’t drive. That wheel is moving,” he says. He exclaims, “These people these days. How are you driving like that? And wouldn’t the car just like?” The mechanic then pantomimes the jostling the Tesla driver must experience while commuting with such significant damage. The next dayIn another portion of the video, the head auto tech in the clip sits in the car. He stares solemnly at the camera and says in a deadpan tone, “I hate Teslas. ” Advertisement The person recording the TikTok approaches him and asks cheekily, “What happened?”The mechanic responds, “I went around the corner. Guess what happened?” He opens the driver’s side door. “Got [expletive] dumped on water. ” The person filming reveals the car seat is drenched in H2O. That’s not all, according to the s",

Then the mechanic is left speechless after seeing this ‘Tesla build quality is SO bad. ’ Jack Alban Posted on February 16 2025 3:00 pm CST @concept3performance/TikTok Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock Nawin27/ShutterStock (Licensed) An incredulous auto service technician couldn’t believe the condition of a Tesla Model 3 that rolled into the shop. The Concept 3 Performance TikTok account (@concept3performance) posted a viral clip that’s accrued over 202,000 views as of Sunday. Featured Video In it, they displayed a glaring issue with a portion of the car’s power train. One that left the lead tech speechless and several commenters decrying Tesla’s build quality. ‘How…is he driving?’“So a 2022 Tesla Model 3 recently changed his brakes and he found this,” the auto tech says to her co-worker. Which prompts him to ask, “How the [expletive] is he driving?” Advertisement Next, the video cuts to footage of a mechanical component of the Tesla vehicle. There appears to be a separation of a U-shaped metallic arm from another portion of the vehicle. Even upon first glance, it seems something is very wrong with the Tesla’s machinery. As the video progresses, it appears that the driver was riding around with a severely damaged control arm. Afterward, the camera pans up towards the auto tech who is still baffled by the damage. “How has he not killed anybody or himself?” he wonders aloud. “It’s a 2022. I don’t even wanna know if he’s changing the brake on a…”A litany of various math equations a la The Hangover begin populating the screen. This appears to be a move to further reinforce how perplexed the tech is over the driver’s disregard for the state of his vehicle.

That’s a rear upper, no?” Advertisement One of the other techs assesses the damage. “I think that’s like lower caster. ”Again, the shop owner expresses just how shocked he is at the driver’s decision to hit the road. “That’s how he’s driving…very dangerous…I highly recommend don’t drive. That wheel is moving,” he says. He exclaims, “These people these days. How are you driving like that? And wouldn’t the car just like?” The mechanic then pantomimes the jostling the Tesla driver must experience while commuting with such significant damage. The next dayIn another portion of the video, the head auto tech in the clip sits in the car. He stares solemnly at the camera and says in a deadpan tone, “I hate Teslas. ” Advertisement The person recording the TikTok approaches him and asks cheekily, “What happened?”The mechanic responds, “I went around the corner. Guess what happened?” He opens the driver’s side door. “Got [expletive] dumped on water. ” The person filming reveals the car seat is drenched in H2O. That’s not all, according to the s",

Then the mechanic is left speechless after seeing this ‘Tesla build quality is SO bad. ’ Jack Alban Posted on February 16 2025 3:00 pm CST @concept3performance/TikTok Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock Nawin27/ShutterStock (Licensed) An incredulous auto service technician couldn’t believe the condition of a Tesla Model 3 that rolled into the shop. The Concept 3 Performance TikTok account (@concept3performance) posted a viral clip that’s accrued over 202,000 views as of Sunday. Featured Video In it, they displayed a glaring issue with a portion of the car’s power train. One that left the lead tech speechless and several commenters decrying Tesla’s build quality. ‘How…is he driving?’“So a 2022 Tesla Model 3 recently changed his brakes and he found this,” the auto tech says to her co-worker. Which prompts him to ask, “How the [expletive] is he driving?” Advertisement Next, the video cuts to footage of a mechanical component of the Tesla vehicle. There appears to be a separation of a U-shaped metallic arm from another portion of the vehicle. Even upon first glance, it seems something is very wrong with the Tesla’s machinery. As the video progresses, it appears that the driver was riding around with a severely damaged control arm. Afterward, the camera pans up towards the auto tech who is still baffled by the damage. “How has he not killed anybody or himself?” he wonders aloud. “It’s a 2022. I don’t even wanna know if he’s changing the brake on a…”A litany of various math equations a la The Hangover begin populating the screen.

That’s a rear upper, no?” Advertisement One of the other techs assesses the damage. “I think that’s like lower caster. ”Again, the shop owner expresses just how shocked he is at the driver’s decision to hit the road. “That’s how he’s driving…very dangerous…I highly recommend don’t drive. That wheel is moving,” he says. He exclaims, “These people these days. How are you driving like that? And wouldn’t the car just like?” The mechanic then pantomimes the jostling the Tesla driver must experience while commuting with such significant damage. The next dayIn another portion of the video, the head auto tech in the clip sits in the car. He stares solemnly at the camera and says in a deadpan tone, “I hate Teslas. ” Advertisement The person recording the TikTok approaches him and asks cheekily, “What happened?”The mechanic responds, “I went around the corner. Guess what happened?” He opens the driver’s side door. “Got [expletive] dumped on water. ” The person filming reveals the car seat is drenched in H2O. That’s not all, according to the s",

Then the mechanic is left speechless after seeing this ‘Tesla build quality is SO bad. ’ Jack Alban Posted on February 16 2025 3:00 pm CST @concept3performance/TikTok Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock Nawin27/ShutterStock (Licensed) An incredulous auto service technician couldn’t believe the condition of a Tesla Model 3 that rolled into the shop. The Concept 3 Performance TikTok account (@concept3performance) posted a viral clip that’s accrued over 202,000 views as of Sunday. Featured Video In it, they displayed a glaring issue with a portion of the car’s power train. One that left the lead tech speechless and several commenters decrying Tesla’s build quality. ‘How…is he driving?’“So a 2022 Tesla Model 3 recently changed his brakes and he found this,” the auto tech says to her co-worker. Which prompts him to ask, “How the [expletive] is he driving?” Advertisement Next, the video cuts to footage of a mechanical component of the Tesla vehicle. There appears to be a separation of a U-shaped metallic arm from another portion of the vehicle. Even upon first glance, it seems something is very wrong with the Tesla’s machinery. As the video progresses, it appears that the driver was riding around with a severely damaged control arm. Afterward, the camera pans up towards the auto tech who is still baffled by the damage. “How has he not killed anybody or himself?” he wonders aloud. “It’s a 2022. I don’t even wanna know if he’s changing the brake on a…”A litany of various math equations a la The Hangover begin populating the screen.

That’s a rear upper, no?” Advertisement One of the other techs assesses the damage. “I think that’s like lower caster. ”Again, the shop owner expresses just how shocked he is at the driver’s decision to hit the road. “That’s how he’s driving…very dangerous…I highly recommend don’t drive. That wheel is moving,” he says. He exclaims, “These people these days. How are you driving like that? And wouldn’t the car just like?” The mechanic then pantomimes the jostling the Tesla driver must experience while commuting with such significant damage. The next dayIn another portion of the video, the head auto tech in the clip sits in the car. He stares solemnly at the camera and says in a deadpan tone, “I hate Teslas. ” Advertisement The person recording the TikTok approaches him and asks cheekily, “What happened?”The mechanic responds, “I went around the corner.

Not So Fast World / Tesla Crash Injured Her Parents, but She Had to Pay Tesla AP looks at how the company successfully sues its critics in China By Newser Editors and Wire Services Posted Feb 16, 2025 3:00 PM CST Copied Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of central China’s Henan province, on March, 9, 2021. Banner reads, “Tesla brake failure. ” (Courtesy Zhang Yazhou via AP) See 6 more photos Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier. Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes—and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1. 1 trillion company. Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk. Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints, or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures. The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by the AP. Tesla won all 11 cases for which the AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court. It is not common practice for automakers—in China or elsewhere—to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards, and limit its accountability. Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment. story continues below Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media, and the courts—which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party—are, by design, somewhat intertwined. Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans, and large tax breaks. Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts—and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality, or contract disputes brought by customers.

Not So Fast World / Tesla Crash Injured Her Parents, but She Had to Pay Tesla AP looks at how the company successfully sues its critics in China By Newser Editors and Wire Services Posted Feb 16, 2025 3:00 PM CST Copied Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of central China’s Henan province, on March, 9, 2021. Banner reads, “Tesla brake failure. ” (Courtesy Zhang Yazhou via AP) See 6 more photos Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier. Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes—and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1. 1 trillion company. Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk. Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints, or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures. The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by the AP. Tesla won all 11 cases for which the AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court. It is not common practice for automakers—in China or elsewhere—to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards, and limit its accountability. Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment. story continues below Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media, and the courts—which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party—are, by design, somewhat intertwined. Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans, and large tax breaks. Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts—and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality, or contract disputes brought by customers. Read the full story, which details some of the crashes and subsequent Tesla legal victories. (More Tesla stories. ) See 6 more photos Report an error Copyright 2025 Newser, LLC. All rights reserved.

Not So Fast World / Tesla Crash Injured Her Parents, but She Had to Pay Tesla AP looks at how the company successfully sues its critics in China By Newser Editors and Wire Services Posted Feb 16, 2025 3:00 PM CST Copied Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of central China’s Henan province, on March, 9, 2021. Banner reads, “Tesla brake failure. ” (Courtesy Zhang Yazhou via AP) See 6 more photos Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier. Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes—and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1. 1 trillion company. Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk. Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints, or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures. The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by the AP. Tesla won all 11 cases for which the AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court. It is not common practice for automakers—in China or elsewhere—to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards, and limit its accountability. Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment. story continues below Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media, and the courts—which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party—are, by design, somewhat intertwined. Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans, and large tax breaks. Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts—and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality, or contract disputes brought by customers. Read the full story, which details some of the crashes and subsequent Tesla legal victories. (More Tesla stories. ) See 6 more photos Report an error Copyright 2025 Newser, LLC. All rights reserved.

Not So Fast World / Tesla Crash Injured Her Parents, but She Had to Pay Tesla AP looks at how the company successfully sues its critics in China By Newser Editors and Wire Services Posted Feb 16, 2025 3:00 PM CST Copied Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of central China’s Henan province, on March, 9, 2021. Banner reads, “Tesla brake failure. ” (Courtesy Zhang Yazhou via AP) See 6 more photos Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier. Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes—and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1. 1 trillion company. Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk. Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints, or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures. The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by the AP. Tesla won all 11 cases for which the AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court. It is not common practice for automakers—in China or elsewhere—to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards, and limit its accountability. Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment. story continues below Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media, and the courts—which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party—are, by design, somewhat intertwined. Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans, and large tax breaks. Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts—and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality, or contract disputes brought by customers. Read the full story, which details some of the crashes and subsequent Tesla legal victories. (More Tesla stories. ) See 6 more photos Report an error Copyright 2025 Newser, LLC. All rights reserved.

Pessoas que protestam na frente das lojas pedem por um boicote da empresa de Elon Musk, afirmando que o bilionário tem tomado medidas retrógradas na Casa Branca, onde passa a maior parte do tempo como um dos conselheiros mais próximos de Donald Trump. Com placas que acusam Musk de nazista, manifestantes tomaram calçadas das lojas da Tesla em cidades como São Francisco, San Jose, Los Gatos e Sunnyvale. A Califórnia é o estado com maior número de carros elétricos dos EUA e um mercado importante para a empresa de Musk. Uma das fábricas da empresa também está localizada no estado, na cidade de Freemont. Os pedidos de boicote tinham como justificativa os cortes liderados por Musk no governo, principalmente em departamentos que incentivavam ações de diversidade e inclusão. Manifestantes também afirmam que a empreitada de Musk no governo americano tem desvirtuado a missão da Tesla em relação aos objetivos dos carros elétricos na Califórnia. ACESSAR AGORA Protestos em São FranciscoOs protestos têm acontecido ao longo de toda a última semana na região de São Francisco e em, em menor escala, outras cidades dos EUA, com dezenas de pessoas com placas pedindo mudanças de Musk. Mesmo sem os boicotes, a Tesla tem visto a consequência de seu posicionamento nas vendas de seus carros na Califórnia. O estado majoritariamente democrata, viu a venda de carros da Tesla cair em cerca de 12% no ano passado, quando Musk se aliou publicamente à campanha para a presidência de Trump. “Nunca, em um milhão de anos, pensei que nosso país fosse chegar a esse ponto”, afirmou uma das manifestantes que estava ao lado de fora de uma das concessionárias, em São Francisco, de acordo com o jornal local The Mercury News.

Pessoas que protestam na frente das lojas pedem por um boicote da empresa de Elon Musk, afirmando que o bilionário tem tomado medidas retrógradas na Casa Branca, onde passa a maior parte do tempo como um dos conselheiros mais próximos de Donald Trump. Com placas que acusam Musk de nazista, manifestantes tomaram calçadas das lojas da Tesla em cidades como São Francisco, San Jose, Los Gatos e Sunnyvale. A Califórnia é o estado com maior número de carros elétricos dos EUA e um mercado importante para a empresa de Musk. Uma das fábricas da empresa também está localizada no estado, na cidade de Freemont. Os pedidos de boicote tinham como justificativa os cortes liderados por Musk no governo, principalmente em departamentos que incentivavam ações de diversidade e inclusão. Manifestantes também afirmam que a empreitada de Musk no governo americano tem desvirtuado a missão da Tesla em relação aos objetivos dos carros elétricos na Califórnia. ACESSAR AGORA Protestos em São FranciscoOs protestos têm acontecido ao longo de toda a última semana na região de São Francisco e em, em menor escala, outras cidades dos EUA, com dezenas de pessoas com placas pedindo mudanças de Musk. Mesmo sem os boicotes, a Tesla tem visto a consequência de seu posicionamento nas vendas de seus carros na Califórnia. O estado majoritariamente democrata, viu a venda de carros da Tesla cair em cerca de 12% no ano passado, quando Musk se aliou publicamente à campanha para a presidência de Trump. “Nunca, em um milhão de anos, pensei que nosso país fosse chegar a esse ponto”, afirmou uma das manifestantes que estava ao lado de fora de uma das concessionárias, em São Francisco, de acordo com o jornal local The Mercury News.

Pessoas que protestam na frente das lojas pedem por um boicote da empresa de Elon Musk, afirmando que o bilionário tem tomado medidas retrógradas na Casa Branca, onde passa a maior parte do tempo como um dos conselheiros mais próximos de Donald Trump. Com placas que acusam Musk de nazista, manifestantes tomaram calçadas das lojas da Tesla em cidades como São Francisco, San Jose, Los Gatos e Sunnyvale. A Califórnia é o estado com maior número de carros elétricos dos EUA e um mercado importante para a empresa de Musk. Uma das fábricas da empresa também está localizada no estado, na cidade de Freemont. Os pedidos de boicote tinham como justificativa os cortes liderados por Musk no governo, principalmente em departamentos que incentivavam ações de diversidade e inclusão. Manifestantes também afirmam que a empreitada de Musk no governo americano tem desvirtuado a missão da Tesla em relação aos objetivos dos carros elétricos na Califórnia. ACESSAR AGORA Protestos em São FranciscoOs protestos têm acontecido ao longo de toda a última semana na região de São Francisco e em, em menor escala, outras cidades dos EUA, com dezenas de pessoas com placas pedindo mudanças de Musk. Mesmo sem os boicotes, a Tesla tem visto a consequência de seu posicionamento nas vendas de seus carros na Califórnia. O estado majoritariamente democrata, viu a venda de carros da Tesla cair em cerca de 12% no ano passado, quando Musk se aliou publicamente à campanha para a presidência de Trump. “Nunca, em um milhão de anos, pensei que nosso país fosse chegar a esse ponto”, afirmou uma das manifestantes que estava ao lado de fora de uma das concessionárias, em São Francisco, de acordo com o jornal local The Mercury News.

Protesters hold signs in front of the Tesla dealership in Palo Alto on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady SheynerThe Tesla dealership in Palo Alto became a scene of protest on Sunday afternoon as more than 400 demonstrators lined two sides of the block to wave signs and chant slogans directed at company CEO Elon Musk, who is playing a leading role in the Trump Administration’s efforts to slash programs and reduce the federal workforce. The demonstration brought activists, politicians and residents from throughout the Peninsula to the El Camino Real block in south Palo Alto. Folk singer and protest icon Joan Baez made the rounds on both sides of El Camino to cheers from the demonstrators, who included residents from Sunnyvale, Redwood City, Mountain View and other area communities. “It’s a moment to do what we can,” Baez said, when asked what brought her to the event. The demonstration was organized by Sally Lieber, a former state Assembly member and Mountain View council member who currently serves on the state Board of Equalization, and the group Together We Will, a chapter of Indivisible, an organization that supports progressive causes. About 150 people initially showed up to the area in front of the Tesla dealership at 1 p. m. , when the event began. The attendance more than doubled within the hour as both sides of the block filled with demonstrators, who also spilled over onto the median island and later to the adjacent block north of El Camino Way. Lieber said that she helped organize the event because she wanted to give people a change to take action now and not wait until the midterm election, when it might be too late to restore some of the programs now being dismantled. “We wanted to provide a platform for people in the community to come out and speak their minds and also make sure people are doing everything they can to mobilize and organize before Musk gets further, because Trump gets further, before JD Vance gets further,” Lieber said. “We have to fight for our rights. We can’t take them for granted anymore. ”Sally Lieber, one of the event organizers, waves during the demonstration in front of Tesla on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady SheynerSunnyvale resident Bruce Hahne, an organizer with Together We Will, said he was encouraged by the turnout he had seen both in Palo Alto and during a Saturday demonstration in Sunnyvale, where about 150 people showed up to protest Musk’s actions. The core message of the demonstrations, he said, is to signal “defense of democracy and opposition to the coup. ”Hahne described the actions of Musk and his newly created task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, to slash funding for federal programs and access sensitive data as clearly illegal. “We need to think of the executive branch as just the executor,” Hahne said. “Their job is to follow the financial instructions of Congress. When Congress says money goes to EPA, money goes to EPA. When ",

Protesters hold signs in front of the Tesla dealership in Palo Alto on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady SheynerThe Tesla dealership in Palo Alto became a scene of protest on Sunday afternoon as more than 400 demonstrators lined two sides of the block to wave signs and chant slogans directed at company CEO Elon Musk, who is playing a leading role in the Trump Administration’s efforts to slash programs and reduce the federal workforce. The demonstration brought activists, politicians and residents from throughout the Peninsula to the El Camino Real block in south Palo Alto. Folk singer and protest icon Joan Baez made the rounds on both sides of El Camino to cheers from the demonstrators, who included residents from Sunnyvale, Redwood City, Mountain View and other area communities. “It’s a moment to do what we can,” Baez said, when asked what brought her to the event. The demonstration was organized by Sally Lieber, a former state Assembly member and Mountain View council member who currently serves on the state Board of Equalization, and the group Together We Will, a chapter of Indivisible, an organization that supports progressive causes. About 150 people initially showed up to the area in front of the Tesla dealership at 1 p. m. , when the event began. The attendance more than doubled within the hour as both sides of the block filled with demonstrators, who also spilled over onto the median island and later to the adjacent block north of El Camino Way. Lieber said that she helped organize the event because she wanted to give people a change to take action now and not wait until the midterm election, when it might be too late to restore some of the programs now being dismantled. “We wanted to provide a platform for people in the community to come out and speak their minds and also make sure people are doing everything they can to mobilize and organize before Musk gets further, because Trump gets further, before JD Vance gets further,” Lieber said. “We have to fight for our rights. We can’t take them for granted anymore. ”Sally Lieber, one of the event organizers, waves during the demonstration in front of Tesla on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady SheynerSunnyvale resident Bruce Hahne, an organizer with Together We Will, said he was encouraged by the turnout he had seen both in Palo Alto and during a Saturday demonstration in Sunnyvale, where about 150 people showed up to protest Musk’s actions. The core message of the demonstrations, he said, is to signal “defense of democracy and opposition to the coup. ”Hahne described the actions of Musk and his newly created task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, to slash funding for federal programs and access sensitive data as clearly illegal. “We need to think of the executive branch as just the executor,” Hahne said. “Their job is to follow the financial instructions of Congress. When Congress says money goes to EPA, money goes to EPA. When ",

Protesters hold signs in front of the Tesla dealership in Palo Alto on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady SheynerThe Tesla dealership in Palo Alto became a scene of protest on Sunday afternoon as more than 400 demonstrators lined two sides of the block to wave signs and chant slogans directed at company CEO Elon Musk, who is playing a leading role in the Trump Administration’s efforts to slash programs and reduce the federal workforce. The demonstration brought activists, politicians and residents from throughout the Peninsula to the El Camino Real block in south Palo Alto. Folk singer and protest icon Joan Baez made the rounds on both sides of El Camino to cheers from the demonstrators, who included residents from Sunnyvale, Redwood City, Mountain View and other area communities. “It’s a moment to do what we can,” Baez said, when asked what brought her to the event. The demonstration was organized by Sally Lieber, a former state Assembly member and Mountain View council member who currently serves on the state Board of Equalization, and the group Together We Will, a chapter of Indivisible, an organization that supports progressive causes. About 150 people initially showed up to the area in front of the Tesla dealership at 1 p. m. , when the event began. The attendance more than doubled within the hour as both sides of the block filled with demonstrators, who also spilled over onto the median island and later to the adjacent block north of El Camino Way. Lieber said that she helped organize the event because she wanted to give people a change to take action now and not wait until the midterm election, when it might be too late to restore some of the programs now being dismantled. “We wanted to provide a platform for people in the community to come out and speak their minds and also make sure people are doing everything they can to mobilize and organize before Musk gets further, because Trump gets further, before JD Vance gets further,” Lieber said. “We have to fight for our rights. We can’t take them for granted anymore. ”Sally Lieber, one of the event organizers, waves during the demonstration in front of Tesla on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady SheynerSunnyvale resident Bruce Hahne, an organizer with Together We Will, said he was encouraged by the turnout he had seen both in Palo Alto and during a Saturday demonstration in Sunnyvale, where about 150 people showed up to protest Musk’s actions. The core message of the demonstrations, he said, is to signal “defense of democracy and opposition to the coup. ”Hahne described the actions of Musk and his newly created task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, to slash funding for federal programs and access sensitive data as clearly illegal. “We need to think of the executive branch as just the executor,” Hahne said. “Their job is to follow the financial instructions of Congress. When Congress says money goes to EPA, money goes to EPA. When ",

Protesters hold signs in front of the Tesla dealership in Palo Alto on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady SheynerThe Tesla dealership in Palo Alto became a scene of protest on Sunday afternoon as more than 400 demonstrators lined two sides of the block to wave signs and chant slogans directed at company CEO Elon Musk, who is playing a leading role in the Trump Administration’s efforts to slash programs and reduce the federal workforce. The demonstration brought activists, politicians and residents from throughout the Peninsula to the El Camino Real block in south Palo Alto. Folk singer and protest icon Joan Baez made the rounds on both sides of El Camino to cheers from the demonstrators, who included residents from Sunnyvale, Redwood City, Mountain View and other area communities. “It’s a moment to do what we can,” Baez said, when asked what brought her to the event. The demonstration was organized by Sally Lieber, a former state Assembly member and Mountain View council member who currently serves on the state Board of Equalization, and the group Together We Will, a chapter of Indivisible, an organization that supports progressive causes. About 150 people initially showed up to the area in front of the Tesla dealership at 1 p. m. , when the event began. The attendance more than doubled within the hour as both sides of the block filled with demonstrators, who also spilled over onto the median island and later to the adjacent block north of El Camino Way. Lieber said that she helped organize the event because she wanted to give people a change to take action now and not wait until the midterm election, when it might be too late to restore some of the programs now being dismantled. “We wanted to provide a platform for people in the community to come out and speak their minds and also make sure people are doing everything they can to mobilize and organize before Musk gets further, because Trump gets further, before JD Vance gets further,” Lieber said. “We have to fight for our rights. We can’t take them for granted anymore. ”Sally Lieber, one of the event organizers, waves during the demonstration in front of Tesla on Feb. 16, 2025. Photo by Gennady SheynerSunnyvale resident Bruce Hahne, an organizer with Together We Will, said he was encouraged by the turnout he had seen both in Palo Alto and during a Saturday demonstration in Sunnyvale, where about 150 people showed up to protest Musk’s actions. The core message of the demonstrations, he said, is to signal “defense of democracy and opposition to the coup. ”Hahne described the actions of Musk and his newly created task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, to slash funding for federal programs and access sensitive data as clearly illegal. “We need to think of the executive branch as just the executor,” Hahne said. “Their job is to follow the financial instructions of Congress. When Congress says money goes to EPA, money goes to EPA. When ",

Founded by Elon Musk in 2017, The Boring Company – or TBC – is an ‘all-electric, zero-emissions, high-speed underground public transportation system’. Dubbed ‘Tesla In Tunnels’, the Loop transportation system has been designed exclusively to work with Tesla brand vehicles. Musk is now planning on bringing the Loop to Dubai, with TBC calling it ‘a landmark collaboration poised to set the standard for urban mobility’. The Boring Company is heading to Dubai with its ‘Tesla tunnels’ The Boring Company currently has one operation ‘loop’: the Vegas Loop, which is in – you’ve guessed it – Las Vegas. TBC says the Loops are the perfect solution for areas with heavy traffic – the sort of which you find in the tourist hotspot of Las Vegas. The Boring Company Now, the company has decided to expand outside of America and recently announced a new Dubai Loop. The United Arab Emirates Artificial Intelligence Minister, Omar Al Olama, announced the project during a video call with Elon Musk during the World Governments Summit last Thursday (February, 13). TBC will partner with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), according to a statement from the company. Speaking during the call, Musk compared the tunnels to ‘wormholes’. “I think once people try it out, they’ll be like wow this is really cool,” he said. “It’ll seem so obvious in retrospect but until you actually do it you don’t know. “It’s going to be great. It’s going to be like a wormhole and you’ll just wormhole from one part of the city and, boom, you’re at another part of the city. It’s great. I’m looking forward to this partnership. ” TBC plans to expand the system to carry 100,000 per hour The initial pilot for the project is set to involve 17km (10. 5 miles) of tunnels underneath Dubai. It will aim to transport up to 20,000 passengers every hour with plans to expand the system to carry 100,000 people per hour ‘providing a high-capacity solution to urban transport demands’, TBC said in the statement. The Boring Company The company said the initial phase will include 11 stations and will see passengers transported at speeds of up to 160km/h (almost 100mph). But there are plans of ‘ultimately expanding into Dubai Loop, a next generation underground transportation system throughout the Emirate of Dubai’. As yet, no timeline has been given for the ambitious project.

Founded by Elon Musk in 2017, The Boring Company – or TBC – is an ‘all-electric, zero-emissions, high-speed underground public transportation system’. Dubbed ‘Tesla In Tunnels’, the Loop transportation system has been designed exclusively to work with Tesla brand vehicles. Musk is now planning on bringing the Loop to Dubai, with TBC calling it ‘a landmark collaboration poised to set the standard for urban mobility’. The Boring Company is heading to Dubai with its ‘Tesla tunnels’ The Boring Company currently has one operation ‘loop’: the Vegas Loop, which is in – you’ve guessed it – Las Vegas. TBC says the Loops are the perfect solution for areas with heavy traffic – the sort of which you find in the tourist hotspot of Las Vegas. The Boring Company Now, the company has decided to expand outside of America and recently announced a new Dubai Loop. The United Arab Emirates Artificial Intelligence Minister, Omar Al Olama, announced the project during a video call with Elon Musk during the World Governments Summit last Thursday (February, 13). TBC will partner with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), according to a statement from the company. Speaking during the call, Musk compared the tunnels to ‘wormholes’. “I think once people try it out, they’ll be like wow this is really cool,” he said. “It’ll seem so obvious in retrospect but until you actually do it you don’t know. “It’s going to be great. It’s going to be like a wormhole and you’ll just wormhole from one part of the city and, boom, you’re at another part of the city. It’s great. I’m looking forward to this partnership. ” TBC plans to expand the system to carry 100,000 per hour The initial pilot for the project is set to involve 17km (10. 5 miles) of tunnels underneath Dubai. It will aim to transport up to 20,000 passengers every hour with plans to expand the system to carry 100,000 people per hour ‘providing a high-capacity solution to urban transport demands’, TBC said in the statement. The Boring Company The company said the initial phase will include 11 stations and will see passengers transported at speeds of up to 160km/h (almost 100mph). But there are plans of ‘ultimately expanding into Dubai Loop, a next generation underground transportation system throughout the Emirate of Dubai’. As yet, no timeline has been given for the ambitious project.

Photo by: Out of Spec Reviews (YouTube) Iulian Dnistran By: Iulian Dnistran Feb 17, at 6:28am ET Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Share Comment How much of an issue is battery degradation on modern EVs? To answer that question, Out of Spec Testing did a range test with a 2019 Tesla Model S. Despite it being less than 10 years old, the car has 250,000 miles on the odometer. Battery degradation is inevitable in electric vehicles, but that doesn’t necessarily mean an EV will suddenly become undrivable after a few years on the road. In fact, the latest research shows that modern batteries could very well outlast the vehicle itself. But statistics are one thing, and experiencing battery degradation first-hand is another. And what better way to show that you could still drive an EV after a quarter of a million miles than to actually show you an EV that has passed the 250,000-mile mark and is still on the road? Thanks to our friends from Out of Spec Testing, we can do just that. In the video embedded below, you’ll see a 2019 Tesla Model S Dual Motor Standard Range that’s still up and running with what is believed to be its original battery pack. When new, the car had a total battery capacity of 75 kilowatt-hours and an EPA-rated range of 285 miles.

That said, the 250,000 miles on the odometer could spell disaster anytime for any type of car and many would steer clear of such a high-mileage car. What sets this particular Model S apart, however, is that it still has a battery warranty from Tesla. Pre-2020 Model S EVs came with an eight-year, unlimited mileage warranty for models with a battery pack larger than 70 kWh. So this car still has two years of warranty left, making it an even better deal. But enough about that, let’s get to the actual range test. The car was fully charged, the tire pressure was set to the manufacturer's recommendation, the suspension was set to the lowest height possible, the A/C was set between 68 and 72 degrees and Range Mode was activated. Range Mode is no longer offered on new Tesla models, but in this older car it disconnects the rear motor, effectively making it front-wheel drive to increase efficiency. The ambient temperature was between 62 and 43 degrees and there were 20 mph winds throughout the test route. The speed was set to 71 mph, which is 70 mph on the GPS. The test ended after 203 miles because the car couldn’t accelerate past 67 mph, but it kept going at slower speeds. Three miles later, the car wouldn’t accelerate at all, and warned the driver to pull over safely. In total, the car drove 206 miles and used 57. 8 kWh of energy, leading to an average efficiency of 3. 6 miles/kWh. By comparison, a 2023 Tesla Model 3 Long Range, which is considered a much more efficient EV, averaged 3. 9 miles/kWh on the same test. What about battery degradation? Well, the test revealed approximately 23% degradation after 250,000 miles. That said, the exact degradation rate is impossible to determine because the testers didn’t know the original usable battery capacity because nobody did a range test when the car was new. That said, the range loss is not bad at all for 250,000 miles. But what do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

Photo by: Out of Spec Reviews (YouTube) Iulian Dnistran By: Iulian Dnistran Feb 17, at 6:28am ET Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Share Comment How much of an issue is battery degradation on modern EVs? To answer that question, Out of Spec Testing did a range test with a 2019 Tesla Model S. Despite it being less than 10 years old, the car has 250,000 miles on the odometer. Battery degradation is inevitable in electric vehicles, but that doesn’t necessarily mean an EV will suddenly become undrivable after a few years on the road. In fact, the latest research shows that modern batteries could very well outlast the vehicle itself. But statistics are one thing, and experiencing battery degradation first-hand is another. And what better way to show that you could still drive an EV after a quarter of a million miles than to actually show you an EV that has passed the 250,000-mile mark and is still on the road? Thanks to our friends from Out of Spec Testing, we can do just that. In the video embedded below, you’ll see a 2019 Tesla Model S Dual Motor Standard Range that’s still up and running with what is believed to be its original battery pack. When new, the car had a total battery capacity of 75 kilowatt-hours and an EPA-rated range of 285 miles.

That said, the 250,000 miles on the odometer could spell disaster anytime for any type of car and many would steer clear of such a high-mileage car. What sets this particular Model S apart, however, is that it still has a battery warranty from Tesla. Pre-2020 Model S EVs came with an eight-year, unlimited mileage warranty for models with a battery pack larger than 70 kWh. So this car still has two years of warranty left, making it an even better deal. But enough about that, let’s get to the actual range test. The car was fully charged, the tire pressure was set to the manufacturer's recommendation, the suspension was set to the lowest height possible, the A/C was set between 68 and 72 degrees and Range Mode was activated. Range Mode is no longer offered on new Tesla models, but in this older car it disconnects the rear motor, effectively making it front-wheel drive to increase efficiency. The ambient temperature was between 62 and 43 degrees and there were 20 mph winds throughout the test route. The speed was set to 71 mph, which is 70 mph on the GPS. The test ended after 203 miles because the car couldn’t accelerate past 67 mph, but it kept going at slower speeds. Three miles later, the car wouldn’t accelerate at all, and warned the driver to pull over safely. In total, the car drove 206 miles and used 57. 8 kWh of energy, leading to an average efficiency of 3. 6 miles/kWh. By comparison, a 2023 Tesla Model 3 Long Range, which is considered a much more efficient EV, averaged 3. 9 miles/kWh on the same test. What about battery degradation? Well, the test revealed approximately 23% degradation after 250,000 miles. That said, the exact degradation rate is impossible to determine because the testers didn’t know the original usable battery capacity because nobody did a range test when the car was new. That said, the range loss is not bad at all for 250,000 miles. But what do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

By CNN Newsource Published February 17, 2025 5:30 AM By Chris Isidore, CNN New York (CNN) — Tesla sales are in an unprecedented slide. Competitors are rapidly gaining ground. There’s a lot of bad news for Tesla lately – but it’s unclear if the politics of its polarizing CEO, Elon Musk, are to blame. What is known is that Tesla had its first-ever drop in global sales last year, as sales fell 1% from 2023. That wouldn’t be a huge decline for many other companies, but it is notable at a company that had recorded 38% and 40% increases in sales the previous two years – and with the massive growth in its share price over the past decade largely predicated on future growth. On a smaller time scale, Tesla did report a sharp drop 16% in US sales between December and January, but that is typical for the company, which seems to make a major push for year-end sales to hit its full-year financial results target, followed by a drop in January. Sales in January 2024, for instance, were off 24% from its December 2023 sales. But Tesla is facing a lot more than a CEO whose eyes have not only been on the federal government, but at least four other companies he’s involved in. And that makes it hard to blame any one element definitively for the company’s relatively rough seas. “It’s still too early to see any (Musk backlash) in the Tesla numbers,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. “We can’t pinpoint that polarization is causing people to buy or avoid a Tesla. ” Musk has become the focus of much attention for his moves to reshape the federal government as he co-hosts Oval Office press conferences with President Donald Trump. And the headwinds for Tesla sales are real, from increased competition to the price of its cars. Perhaps the biggest sign of shift in interest in owning a Telsa comes from S\u0026P Global Mobility, which has sales data on a state-by-state basis. It broke the data into “blue states,” meaning states that voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and “red states” where Republicans won four straight elections. And within each group of states, it looked at the percentage of household that already owned a Tesla that bought another one when purchasing a new car. In the blue states, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell, from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% in the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, repeat Tesla buyers in red states edged up very slightly from 47. 6% at the end of 2023 to 48. 2% during the last three months of last year. The drop in loyalty rate for Tesla owners in blue states resulted in Tesla losing about 1 percentage point of market share overall in those states, which includes some of the nation’s biggest car markets, such as California/ There’s some additional anecdotal evidence to suggest that some buyers may have been turned off by Musk’s political activism. Valdez Streaty points to polling of potential car buyers this month by Morning Consult that shows that nearly 32% of US buyers “would not consider” buying a Tesla. That’s up from 27% in a Morning Consult sur",

By CNN Newsource New Published February 17, 2025 4:30 AM By Chris Isidore, CNN New York (CNN) — Tesla sales are in an unprecedented slide. Competitors are rapidly gaining ground. There’s a lot of bad news for Tesla lately – but it’s unclear if the politics of its polarizing CEO, Elon Musk, are to blame. What is known is that Tesla had its first-ever drop in global sales last year, as sales fell 1% from 2023. That wouldn’t be a huge decline for many other companies, but it is notable at a company that had recorded 38% and 40% increases in sales the previous two years – and with the massive growth in its share price over the past decade largely predicated on future growth. On a smaller time scale, Tesla did report a sharp drop 16% in US sales between December and January, but that is typical for the company, which seems to make a major push for year-end sales to hit its full-year financial results target, followed by a drop in January. Sales in January 2024, for instance, were off 24% from its December 2023 sales. But Tesla is facing a lot more than a CEO whose eyes have not only been on the federal government, but at least four other companies he’s involved in. And that makes it hard to blame any one element definitively for the company’s relatively rough seas. “It’s still too early to see any (Musk backlash) in the Tesla numbers,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. “We can’t pinpoint that polarization is causing people to buy or avoid a Tesla. ” Musk has become the focus of much attention for his moves to reshape the federal government as he co-hosts Oval Office press conferences with President Donald Trump. And the headwinds for Tesla sales are real, from increased competition to the price of its cars. Perhaps the biggest sign of shift in interest in owning a Telsa comes from S\u0026P Global Mobility, which has sales data on a state-by-state basis. It broke the data into “blue states,” meaning states that voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and “red states” where Republicans won four straight elections. And within each group of states, it looked at the percentage of household that already owned a Tesla that bought another one when purchasing a new car. In the blue states, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell, from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% in the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, repeat Tesla buyers in red states edged up very slightly from 47. 6% at the end of 2023 to 48. 2% during the last three months of last year. The drop in loyalty rate for Tesla owners in blue states resulted in Tesla losing about 1 percentage point of market share overall in those states, which includes some of the nation’s biggest car markets, such as California/ There’s some additional anecdotal evidence to suggest that some buyers may have been turned off by Musk’s political activism. Valdez Streaty points to polling of potential car buyers this month by Morning Consult that shows that nearly 32% of US buyers “would not consider” buying a Tesla. That’s up from 27% in a Morning Consult survey a year ago, and only 17% when it asked the question in in February 2021. By comparison, only 16% of potential buyers were almost certain or very likely to look at a Tesla before buying in the most recent survey, a figure that hasn’t changed much over the last four years. The rise in people who say they are crossing Tesla off their shopping list is not nearly as great as those now expressing a negative view of Musk. A January poll by Quinnipiac University found that 53% of vo",

He used math to demonstrate a groundbreaking feature to win his buddy over. In a video shared to TikTok, Braden Smith demonstrated how the Cybertruck’s Powershare feature could be used for welding jobs. Welding may not be the first thing you think of when you hear the name ‘Tesla’, but we love a multi-use vehicle. DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie How the Cybertruck’s Powershare feature can be harnessed for welding To lay out his math, Smith, who described himself as the ‘Cybertruck farmer’, used the dusty rear of his Cybertruck to do some multiplications. The Cybertruck runs off a 240-volt outlet, pulling 40 amps off a 50-amp plug. @meetthesmithfamily #cybertruck #dieselbrothers #welding #farming #tesla @Sparks Motors ♬ original sound – The Smiths This gives you 9. 6 kilowatt-hours. To put it another way, if you’re using your welding equipment for a full day, you’d still have enough battery power left to drive home. After a hypothetical 10 hour welding job, you’d have 25 percent battery left to get you home. MeettheSmiths/TikTok The truck’s battery has a 123 kilowatt-hour capacity, which is more than enough. After breaking down the numbers, Smith’s friend commented: ‘I think this sold me on the Cybertruck’. From this comment, we can deduce that his friend does welding on a regular basis. At any rate, it’s a much more muted response compared to what this retired Ford builder had to say. The Powershare technology is a great innovation, and has many uses. As noted on the Tesla website, it allows drivers to charge up electronic devices, other EVs and even their own homes, in case of a blackout. The power outlets are built into the vehicle, with two 120 V outlets in the cabin and two 120 V outlets and one 240 V outlet in the cargo bed. Not just a city car – the Cybertruck can adapt to country life too Smith’s TikTok channel has frequently demonstrated the perks of owning an EV on a farm. He has shown it helping when hauling grain and farm gear, as reported by The Cool Down. MeettheSmiths/TikTok The uses of a Cybertruck can often prove to be quite surprising. Sure, we all know it strikes an imposing figure when being driven down the road of a town. But it also proves handy in other circumstances too – especially when it comes to towing, as demonstrated with this Rivian along a Colorado mountain road. It can also be used to test other EVs, namely the all-electric Pebble Flow RV.

He used math to demonstrate a groundbreaking feature to win his buddy over. In a video shared to TikTok, Braden Smith demonstrated how the Cybertruck’s Powershare feature could be used for welding jobs. Welding may not be the first thing you think of when you hear the name ‘Tesla’, but we love a multi-use vehicle. DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie How the Cybertruck’s Powershare feature can be harnessed for welding To lay out his math, Smith, who described himself as the ‘Cybertruck farmer’, used the dusty rear of his Cybertruck to do some multiplications. The Cybertruck runs off a 240-volt outlet, pulling 40 amps off a 50-amp plug. @meetthesmithfamily #cybertruck #dieselbrothers #welding #farming #tesla @Sparks Motors ♬ original sound – The Smiths This gives you 9. 6 kilowatt-hours. To put it another way, if you’re using your welding equipment for a full day, you’d still have enough battery power left to drive home. After a hypothetical 10 hour welding job, you’d have 25 percent battery left to get you home. MeettheSmiths/TikTok The truck’s battery has a 123 kilowatt-hour capacity, which is more than enough. After breaking down the numbers, Smith’s friend commented: ‘I think this sold me on the Cybertruck’. From this comment, we can deduce that his friend does welding on a regular basis. At any rate, it’s a much more muted response compared to what this retired Ford builder had to say. The Powershare technology is a great innovation, and has many uses. As noted on the Tesla website, it allows drivers to charge up electronic devices, other EVs and even their own homes, in case of a blackout. The power outlets are built into the vehicle, with two 120 V outlets in the cabin and two 120 V outlets and one 240 V outlet in the cargo bed. Not just a city car – the Cybertruck can adapt to country life too Smith’s TikTok channel has frequently demonstrated the perks of owning an EV on a farm. He has shown it helping when hauling grain and farm gear, as reported by The Cool Down. MeettheSmiths/TikTok The uses of a Cybertruck can often prove to be quite surprising. Sure, we all know it strikes an imposing figure when being driven down the road of a town. But it also proves handy in other circumstances too – especially when it comes to towing, as demonstrated with this Rivian along a Colorado mountain road. It can also be used to test other EVs, namely the all-electric Pebble Flow RV.
