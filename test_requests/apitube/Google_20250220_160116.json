Over the past two decades, what started out as a simple mapping app has become an indispensable tool that helps us explore new places, connect with communities, and easily navigate the world. To mark this special occasion, Google Maps has highlighted the top 20 most-reviewed visitor attractions in the Philippines. These destinations showcase the diverse locations our country offers, from historic landmarks to natural wonders. Here are the Top 20 Most-Reviewed Attractions in the Philippines: Quezon Memorial Circle Magellan’s Cross Temple of Leah Cagsawa Ruins Chocolate Hills Complex Loboc River Cruise Twin Lakes Tagaytay The Ruins Lion’s Head Alona Beach Hinagdanan Cave Bangui Windmills Cambugahay Falls Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden (Old Diplomat Hotel) MacArthur Leyte Landing Memorial National Park, Palo José Rizal Monument Cloud 9 Surfing Area Calle Crisologo City of Naga Boardwalk Intramuros Over the years, Google Maps has become much more than a map.

What will happen following Thursday’s wet weather? CNN - Money Apple and Google restore TikTok to their US app stores By CNN Newsource Published February 13, 2025 5:37 PM By Ramishah Maruf and Clare Duffy, CNN New York (CNN) — Google Play said it restored TikTok to the US app store on Thursday, following promises by President Donald Trump to save the app and an executive action delaying the enactment of a ban on the wildly popular social media platform. Bloomberg and CNBC also reported that Apple will restore the app to its app store on Thursday evening. TikTok was available on app stores as of Thursday evening, according to CNN attempts to download the app on different phones. TikTok’s uncertain future stems from a law signed last April by then-President Joe Biden, which gave China’s ByteDance 270 days to sell the app to an owner from the United States or one of its allies or face a ban, based on US national security concerns. The day before the blackout, the Supreme Court upheld the ban. TikTok shut down for roughly 14 hours in January but attributed its quick return to promises made by the then president-elect Donald Trump to keep the platform working in the US. But its 175 million users still ran into at least one problem: The app was, as of that January weekend, unavailable on Apple and Google Play stores, along with Lemon8 and CapCut, which are also owned by TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance. Apple previously said in a statement it removed TikTok from the app store because of the ban, but the app remained available for customers who already downloaded it. Tech companies faced consequences Trump signaled before taking office that he would sign an executive action delaying enforcement of the ban and TikTok had credited him for the reason the app came back. “I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on January 19. He added that he would not hold TikTok’s technology partners — including Apple, Google and cloud computing company Oracle — liable for continuing to make the app available until he signed the order. The law required only that TikTok’s technology partners — including Oracle, which hosts TikTok’s content in the United States, and Apple and Google, which host the app on their app stores — stop supporting the app or face fines of up to $5,000 per person who has access to the platform starting Sunday.

Bloomberg and CNBC also reported that Apple will restore the app to its app store on Thursday evening. TikTok was available on app stores as of Thursday evening, according to CNN attempts to download the app on different phones. TikTok’s uncertain future stems from a law signed last April by then-President Joe Biden, which gave China’s ByteDance 270 days to sell the app to an owner from the United States or one of its allies or face a ban, based on US national security concerns. The day before the blackout, the Supreme Court upheld the ban. TikTok shut down for roughly 14 hours in January but attributed its quick return to promises made by the then president-elect Donald Trump to keep the platform working in the US. But its 175 million users still ran into at least one problem: The app was, as of that January weekend, unavailable on Apple and Google Play stores, along with Lemon8 and CapCut, which are also owned by TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance. Apple previously said in a statement it removed TikTok from the app store because of the ban, but the app remained available for customers who already downloaded it. Tech companies faced consequences Trump signaled before taking office that he would sign an executive action delaying enforcement of the ban and TikTok had credited him for the reason the app came back. “I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on January 19. He added that he would not hold TikTok’s technology partners — including Apple, Google and cloud computing company Oracle — liable for continuing to make the app available until he signed the order. The law required only that TikTok’s technology partners — including Oracle, which hosts TikTok’s content in the United States, and Apple and Google, which host the app on their app stores — stop supporting the app or face fines of up to $5,000 per person who has access to the platform starting Sunday. Trump took office the next day, on January 20. He signed the executive order later that day, giving TikTok another 75 days to find a new owner. Trump’s promises to save TikTok The action says the 75-day delay would help the Trump administration attempt to “determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans. ” Trump told reporters that he changed his mind on TikTok because he “got to use it. ” “And remember, TikTok is largely about kids, young kids,” Trump said in the Oval Office when asked what changed his mind. “If China is going to get information about young kids out of it, to be honest, I think we ha",

PCMag UK NewsCars \u0026 Auto GPS Navigation Google Maps Adds Weather-Related Incident Reports for Safer Driving The app now lets users report flooded or unplowed roads and low visibility. By Jibin Joseph Feb 14, 2025 (Credit: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) Google Maps is adding more options to its incident-reporting feature, which will allow drivers to avoid or prepare for dangerous weather conditions. As spotted by Android Police, Maps now allows users to flag flooded roads, low visibility, and unplowed roads. The new incident types first appeared on Android Auto before showing up on iOS, but it does not appear to be available on Android yet. Google Maps' new weather-related incident reports on iOS(Credit: PCMag)Incident reporting has been a standout feature on Waze, which Google acquired in 2013. It allows users to report crashes, incorrect directions, police checks, and more. For a long time, Google Maps couldn’t match the quality of the reporting on its own Maps app, which mainly showed alerts for congestion, crashes, or roadwork. Last year, Google added community-driven Waze incident reports to Maps, allowing users to spot a \"police ahead\" report from Waze on Maps. Users’ responses to incident reporting have been divided. While some like the important warnings they receive, others opine that too many alerts could be distracting. “Every couple of minutes a warning (incident report) pops up asking about a stalled car, roadworks. Asking me to confirm if the issue is still there. Every time this stops the music playing. I have to swipe into the YouTube Music app and hit play again,” complained a Redditor. One drawback of the feature is that once users flag an issue, Maps will ask every driver passing by if the issue persists. If too many drivers don’t respond, the app could show the alert even after it’s been resolved.

PCMag UK NewsCars \u0026 Auto GPS Navigation Google Maps Adds Weather-Related Incident Reports for Safer Driving The app now lets users report flooded or unplowed roads and low visibility. By Jibin Joseph Feb 14, 2025 (Credit: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) Google Maps is adding more options to its incident-reporting feature, which will allow drivers to avoid or prepare for dangerous weather conditions. As spotted by Android Police, Maps now allows users to flag flooded roads, low visibility, and unplowed roads. The new incident types first appeared on Android Auto before showing up on iOS, but it does not appear to be available on Android yet. Google Maps' new weather-related incident reports on iOS(Credit: PCMag)Incident reporting has been a standout feature on Waze, which Google acquired in 2013. It allows users to report crashes, incorrect directions, police checks, and more. For a long time, Google Maps couldn’t match the quality of the reporting on its own Maps app, which mainly showed alerts for congestion, crashes, or roadwork. Last year, Google added community-driven Waze incident reports to Maps, allowing users to spot a \"police ahead\" report from Waze on Maps. Users’ responses to incident reporting have been divided. While some like the important warnings they receive, others opine that too many alerts could be distracting. “Every couple of minutes a warning (incident report) pops up asking about a stalled car, roadworks. Asking me to confirm if the issue is still there. Every time this stops the music playing. I have to swipe into the YouTube Music app and hit play again,” complained a Redditor. One drawback of the feature is that once users flag an issue, Maps will ask every driver passing by if the issue persists. If too many drivers don’t respond, the app could show the alert even after it’s been resolved.

NASSAU, The Bahamas — Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism Investments and Aviation the Hon. Chester Cooper expressed excitement that visitors will be able to capture the beauty of the islands through the very popular digital app Google Maps. This is being made possible through an extensive Google Street View Coverage Project, spearheaded by World Travel in 360, a leading specialist in 360-degree tourism promotion, in collaboration with the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, Investments \u0026 Aviation. The project was announced on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, in Pompey Square, downtown Nassau. “We are excited to collaborate with World Travel in 360 and smooth a path for Google Street View to immortalize our islands with 360-degree imagery on Google Maps,” said the minister. He added, “Access and engagement are bedrock principles of tourism success. This project will make it easy for travelers from around the world to size up the beauty and wonders of The Bahamas from wherever they are. ” The project will see several street view-equipped vehicles with mounted camera systems roaming roadways throughout the islands to capture more than 2,000,000 geolocated 360-degree images for showcasing the country on Google Maps. The Bahamas Street View Coverage for Google Maps is proposed to capture imagery of more than 3,729 miles (6,000 kilometres) of key tourist areas throughout the country’s more than 700 islands, including 16 major islands featuring towns, beaches and other attractions that are visited by millions of in-coming travelers. With the imagery capture, The Bahamas will join more than 100 countries and territories currently featured, in whole or in part, on the Street View function of Google Maps, which enables users to explore settings around the world via 360-degree images. The function is among the most popular features of applications on Google Maps, enabling users to effortlessly plan visits, observe attractions, pinpoint restaurants and hotels and more, using the convenience of technologies including mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Among a host of popular tourist areas proposed to be photographed through the Street View Project are Downtown Nassau and Montagu Beach in Nassau; Port Lucaya Marketplace and Peterson Cay National Park in Grand Bahama; and Marsh Harbour, Green Turtle Cay and Cherokee Sound in The Abacos. Street View is not for vacation planning alone, but benefits of imagery-captured ranges from support for urban planning and emergency response, to historical preservation and environmental conservation. Special considerations are also being made to increase public awareness of the Street View Project locally in The Bahamas, as well as for the mapping of sensitive areas and special restrictions and permission for capturing images in public areas. Director General of Tourism Latia Duncombe also weighed in on the digital project. “In today’s digital landscape, immersive experiences are key to attracting travelers,” she said. “This Google Street View initiative is a game-changer for Bahamian tourism. By bringing our islands to life on Google Maps, we’re not just showcasing our beauty, we’re making The Bahamas more accessible than ever before. ”Added the director general, “Potential visitors can explore our diverse offerings virtually in the palm of their hands, igniting their desire to visit and experience the authentic wonder of our islands firsthand. This initiative also presents a tremendous opportunity for local businesses — restaurants, hotels, and attractions — by increasing their visibility to a global audience and making it easier for travelers to discover and support them before they even arrive. ” (BIS Photos/Kemuel Stubbs) SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePrime Minister Davis terms Signing of MOU with the Dundas Centre a ‘landmark occasion’Next articleAnother high school teacher charged with assaulting a 15-year-old boy… media RELATED ARTICLESMORE FRO",

NASSAU, The Bahamas — Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism Investments and Aviation the Hon. Chester Cooper expressed excitement that visitors will be able to capture the beauty of the islands through the very popular digital app Google Maps. This is being made possible through an extensive Google Street View Coverage Project, spearheaded by World Travel in 360, a leading specialist in 360-degree tourism promotion, in collaboration with the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, Investments \u0026 Aviation. The project was announced on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, in Pompey Square, downtown Nassau. “We are excited to collaborate with World Travel in 360 and smooth a path for Google Street View to immortalize our islands with 360-degree imagery on Google Maps,” said the minister. He added, “Access and engagement are bedrock principles of tourism success. This project will make it easy for travelers from around the world to size up the beauty and wonders of The Bahamas from wherever they are. ” The project will see several street view-equipped vehicles with mounted camera systems roaming roadways throughout the islands to capture more than 2,000,000 geolocated 360-degree images for showcasing the country on Google Maps. The Bahamas Street View Coverage for Google Maps is proposed to capture imagery of more than 3,729 miles (6,000 kilometres) of key tourist areas throughout the country’s more than 700 islands, including 16 major islands featuring towns, beaches and other attractions that are visited by millions of in-coming travelers. With the imagery capture, The Bahamas will join more than 100 countries and territories currently featured, in whole or in part, on the Street View function of Google Maps, which enables users to explore settings around the world via 360-degree images. The function is among the most popular features of applications on Google Maps, enabling users to effortlessly plan visits, observe attractions, pinpoint restaurants and hotels and more, using the convenience of technologies including mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Among a host of popular tourist areas proposed to be photographed through the Street View Project are Downtown Nassau and Montagu Beach in Nassau; Port Lucaya Marketplace and Peterson Cay National Park in Grand Bahama; and Marsh Harbour, Green Turtle Cay and Cherokee Sound in The Abacos. Street View is not for vacation planning alone, but benefits of imagery-captured ranges from support for urban planning and emergency response, to historical preservation and environmental conservation. Special considerations are also being made to increase public awareness of the Street View Project locally in The Bahamas, as well as for the mapping of sensitive areas and special restrictions and permission for capturing images in public areas. Director General of Tourism Latia Duncombe also weighed in on the digital project. “In today’s digital landscape, immersive experiences are key to attracting travelers,” she said. “This Google Street View initiative is a game-changer for Bahamian tourism. By bringing our islands to life on Google Maps, we’re not just showcasing our beauty, we’re making The Bahamas more accessible than ever before. ”Added the director general, “Potential visitors can explore our diverse offerings virtually in the palm of their hands, igniting their desire to visit and experience the authentic wonder of our islands firsthand. This initiative also presents a tremendous opportunity for local businesses — restaurants, hotels, and attractions — by increasing their visibility to a global audience and making it easier for travelers to discover and support them before they even arrive. ” (BIS Photos/Kemuel Stubbs) SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePrime Minister Davis terms Signing of MOU with the Dundas Centre a ‘landmark occasion’Next articleAnother high school teacher charged with assaulting a 15-year-old boy… media RELATED ARTICLESMORE FRO",

NASSAU, The Bahamas — Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism Investments and Aviation the Hon. Chester Cooper expressed excitement that visitors will be able to capture the beauty of the islands through the very popular digital app Google Maps. This is being made possible through an extensive Google Street View Coverage Project, spearheaded by World Travel in 360, a leading specialist in 360-degree tourism promotion, in collaboration with the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, Investments \u0026 Aviation. The project was announced on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, in Pompey Square, downtown Nassau. “We are excited to collaborate with World Travel in 360 and smooth a path for Google Street View to immortalize our islands with 360-degree imagery on Google Maps,” said the minister. He added, “Access and engagement are bedrock principles of tourism success. This project will make it easy for travelers from around the world to size up the beauty and wonders of The Bahamas from wherever they are. ” The project will see several street view-equipped vehicles with mounted camera systems roaming roadways throughout the islands to capture more than 2,000,000 geolocated 360-degree images for showcasing the country on Google Maps. The Bahamas Street View Coverage for Google Maps is proposed to capture imagery of more than 3,729 miles (6,000 kilometres) of key tourist areas throughout the country’s more than 700 islands, including 16 major islands featuring towns, beaches and other attractions that are visited by millions of in-coming travelers. With the imagery capture, The Bahamas will join more than 100 countries and territories currently featured, in whole or in part, on the Street View function of Google Maps, which enables users to explore settings around the world via 360-degree images. The function is among the most popular features of applications on Google Maps, enabling users to effortlessly plan visits, observe attractions, pinpoint restaurants and hotels and more, using the convenience of technologies including mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Among a host of popular tourist areas proposed to be photographed through the Street View Project are Downtown Nassau and Montagu Beach in Nassau; Port Lucaya Marketplace and Peterson Cay National Park in Grand Bahama; and Marsh Harbour, Green Turtle Cay and Cherokee Sound in The Abacos. Street View is not for vacation planning alone, but benefits of imagery-captured ranges from support for urban planning and emergency response, to historical preservation and environmental conservation. Special considerations are also being made to increase public awareness of the Street View Project locally in The Bahamas, as well as for the mapping of sensitive areas and special restrictions and permission for capturing images in public areas. Director General of Tourism Latia Duncombe also weighed in on the digital project. “In today’s digital landscape, immersive experiences are key to attracting travelers,” she said. “This Google Street View initiative is a game-changer for Bahamian tourism. By bringing our islands to life on Google Maps, we’re not just showcasing our beauty, we’re making The Bahamas more accessible than ever before. ”Added the director general, “Potential visitors can explore our diverse offerings virtually in the palm of their hands, igniting their desire to visit and experience the authentic wonder of our islands firsthand. This initiative also presents a tremendous opportunity for local businesses — restaurants, hotels, and attractions — by increasing their visibility to a global audience and making it easier for travelers to discover and support them before they even arrive. ” (BIS Photos/Kemuel Stubbs) SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePrime Minister Davis terms Signing of MOU with the Dundas Centre a ‘landmark occasion’Next articleAnother high school teacher charged with assaulting a 15-year-old boy… media RELATED ARTICLESMORE FRO",

NASSAU, The Bahamas — Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism Investments and Aviation the Hon. Chester Cooper expressed excitement that visitors will be able to capture the beauty of the islands through the very popular digital app Google Maps. This is being made possible through an extensive Google Street View Coverage Project, spearheaded by World Travel in 360, a leading specialist in 360-degree tourism promotion, in collaboration with the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, Investments \u0026 Aviation. The project was announced on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, in Pompey Square, downtown Nassau. “We are excited to collaborate with World Travel in 360 and smooth a path for Google Street View to immortalize our islands with 360-degree imagery on Google Maps,” said the minister. He added, “Access and engagement are bedrock principles of tourism success. This project will make it easy for travelers from around the world to size up the beauty and wonders of The Bahamas from wherever they are. ” The project will see several street view-equipped vehicles with mounted camera systems roaming roadways throughout the islands to capture more than 2,000,000 geolocated 360-degree images for showcasing the country on Google Maps. The Bahamas Street View Coverage for Google Maps is proposed to capture imagery of more than 3,729 miles (6,000 kilometres) of key tourist areas throughout the country’s more than 700 islands, including 16 major islands featuring towns, beaches and other attractions that are visited by millions of in-coming travelers. With the imagery capture, The Bahamas will join more than 100 countries and territories currently featured, in whole or in part, on the Street View function of Google Maps, which enables users to explore settings around the world via 360-degree images. The function is among the most popular features of applications on Google Maps, enabling users to effortlessly plan visits, observe attractions, pinpoint restaurants and hotels and more, using the convenience of technologies including mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Among a host of popular tourist areas proposed to be photographed through the Street View Project are Downtown Nassau and Montagu Beach in Nassau; Port Lucaya Marketplace and Peterson Cay National Park in Grand Bahama; and Marsh Harbour, Green Turtle Cay and Cherokee Sound in The Abacos. Street View is not for vacation planning alone, but benefits of imagery-captured ranges from support for urban planning and emergency response, to historical preservation and environmental conservation. Special considerations are also being made to increase public awareness of the Street View Project locally in The Bahamas, as well as for the mapping of sensitive areas and special restrictions and permission for capturing images in public areas. Director General of Tourism Latia Duncombe also weighed in on the digital project. “In today’s digital landscape, immersive experiences are key to attracting travelers,” she said. “This Google Street View initiative is a game-changer for Bahamian tourism. By bringing our islands to life on Google Maps, we’re not just showcasing our beauty, we’re making The Bahamas more accessible than ever before. ”Added the director general, “Potential visitors can explore our diverse offerings virtually in the palm of their hands, igniting their desire to visit and experience the authentic wonder of our islands firsthand. This initiative also presents a tremendous opportunity for local businesses — restaurants, hotels, and attractions — by increasing their visibility to a global audience and making it easier for travelers to discover and support them before they even arrive. ” (BIS Photos/Kemuel Stubbs) SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePrime Minister Davis terms Signing of MOU with the Dundas Centre a ‘landmark occasion’Next articleAnother high school teacher charged with assaulting a 15-year-old boy… media RELATED ARTICLESMORE FRO",

S. stock indexes drifted following mixed profit reports from big companies. The S\u0026P 500 barely budged and slipped by less than 0. 1%, a day after rallying within 0. 1% of its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 165 points, or 0. 4%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0. 4%. The S\u0026P 500 still closed out its first winning week in the last three thanks in part to reports showing companies made even fatter profits at the end of 2024 than analysts expected. They’ve helped the market power through a range of worries centered on higher interest rates and stubborn inflation. Airbnb climbed 14. 4% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected as customers booked more nights on its platform. Wynn Resorts jumped 10. 4% after likewise topping earnings expectations, thanks in part to strength for its Las Vegas operations. TikTok returns to Apple and Google app storesTikTok has returned to the app stores of Apple and Google in the U. S. , after President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a TikTok ban. TikTok, which is operated by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, was removed from Apple and Google’s app stores on Jan. 18 to comply with a law that requires ByteDance to divest the app or be banned in the U. S. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s move on Friday. Apple did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

S. stock indexes drifted following mixed profit reports from big companies. The S\u0026P 500 barely budged and slipped by less than 0. 1%, a day after rallying within 0. 1% of its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 165 points, or 0. 4%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0. 4%. The S\u0026P 500 still closed out its first winning week in the last three thanks in part to reports showing companies made even fatter profits at the end of 2024 than analysts expected. They’ve helped the market power through a range of worries centered on higher interest rates and stubborn inflation. Airbnb climbed 14. 4% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected as customers booked more nights on its platform. Wynn Resorts jumped 10. 4% after likewise topping earnings expectations, thanks in part to strength for its Las Vegas operations. TikTok returns to Apple and Google app storesTikTok has returned to the app stores of Apple and Google in the U. S. , after President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a TikTok ban. TikTok, which is operated by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, was removed from Apple and Google’s app stores on Jan. 18 to comply with a law that requires ByteDance to divest the app or be banned in the U. S. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s move on Friday. Apple did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Why Big Tech is pulling back In 2019, a woman walks below a Google sign on the campus in Mountain View, Calif. (Associated Press) By Queenie Wong and Wendy Lee Feb. 15, 2025 3 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print More than a decade ago, outcries about the lack of diversity in the tech industry reverberated across major Silicon Valley companies from Facebook to Google. Women and minorities spoke out about feeling out of place in male-dominated professions, civil rights activists urged businesses to do more and tech workers like Tracy Chou, who was a software engineer at Pinterest at the time, pushed companies to release diversity data. “There was already some movement in that direction, at least a feeling like we should do this,” said Chou, who wrote a viral Medium post in 2013 about the lack of female engineers. “What I happened to crystallize was a line of thinking that really resonated with the more data-driven side of the industry. ” Advertisement For diversity advocates like Chou, the tide has now turned. Facing more political pressure and legal risks during President Trump’s second administration, tech companies that previously championed diversity including Google, Meta (Facebook’s parent company) and Amazon are scaling back, scrapping or rethinking their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Business Google ends hiring targets tied to diversity Google is the latest company to roll back DEI efforts amid more political pressure to do so under President Trump. Feb. 5, 2025 It’s part of a broader retrenchment across the business community. About 20% of companies in the Standard \u0026 Poor’s 100 have retreated from DEI commitments since Trump was elected, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. Those include Target Corp. , McDonald’s Corp. and Disney. Trump and Elon Musk, who spent more than $200 million to help elect the president to a second term, have been vocal critics of DEI programs. In a fact sheet about Trump’s executive order, the White House said many corporations use DEI as “an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices,” sending a message to businesses that they could get sued. Companies such as Google and Amazon also contract with federal agencies. Advertisement “They’re reading the room, especially with Trump and Elon running the country,” said Chou, now the chief executive of Block Party, a tool that helps users combat online harassment. Corporate pledges to fight racism including from Musk’s company Tesla",

Why Big Tech is pulling back In 2019, a woman walks below a Google sign on the campus in Mountain View, Calif. (Associated Press) By Queenie Wong and Wendy Lee Feb. 15, 2025 3 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print More than a decade ago, outcries about the lack of diversity in the tech industry reverberated across major Silicon Valley companies from Facebook to Google. Women and minorities spoke out about feeling out of place in male-dominated professions, civil rights activists urged businesses to do more and tech workers like Tracy Chou, who was a software engineer at Pinterest at the time, pushed companies to release diversity data. “There was already some movement in that direction, at least a feeling like we should do this,” said Chou, who wrote a viral Medium post in 2013 about the lack of female engineers. “What I happened to crystallize was a line of thinking that really resonated with the more data-driven side of the industry. ” Advertisement For diversity advocates like Chou, the tide has now turned. Facing more political pressure and legal risks during President Trump’s second administration, tech companies that previously championed diversity including Google, Meta (Facebook’s parent company) and Amazon are scaling back, scrapping or rethinking their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Business Google ends hiring targets tied to diversity Google is the latest company to roll back DEI efforts amid more political pressure to do so under President Trump. Feb. 5, 2025 It’s part of a broader retrenchment across the business community. About 20% of companies in the Standard \u0026 Poor’s 100 have retreated from DEI commitments since Trump was elected, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. Those include Target Corp. , McDonald’s Corp. and Disney. Trump and Elon Musk, who spent more than $200 million to help elect the president to a second term, have been vocal critics of DEI programs. In a fact sheet about Trump’s executive order, the White House said many corporations use DEI as “an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices,” sending a message to businesses that they could get sued. Companies such as Google and Amazon also contract with federal agencies. Advertisement “They’re reading the room, especially with Trump and Elon running the country,” said Chou, now the chief executive of Block Party, a tool that helps users combat online harassment. Corporate pledges to fight racism including from Musk’s company Tesla",

Why Big Tech is pulling back In 2019, a woman walks below a Google sign on the campus in Mountain View, Calif. (Associated Press) By Queenie Wong and Wendy Lee Feb. 15, 2025 3 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print More than a decade ago, outcries about the lack of diversity in the tech industry reverberated across major Silicon Valley companies from Facebook to Google. Women and minorities spoke out about feeling out of place in male-dominated professions, civil rights activists urged businesses to do more and tech workers like Tracy Chou, who was a software engineer at Pinterest at the time, pushed companies to release diversity data. “There was already some movement in that direction, at least a feeling like we should do this,” said Chou, who wrote a viral Medium post in 2013 about the lack of female engineers. “What I happened to crystallize was a line of thinking that really resonated with the more data-driven side of the industry. ” Advertisement For diversity advocates like Chou, the tide has now turned. Facing more political pressure and legal risks during President Trump’s second administration, tech companies that previously championed diversity including Google, Meta (Facebook’s parent company) and Amazon are scaling back, scrapping or rethinking their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Business Google ends hiring targets tied to diversity Google is the latest company to roll back DEI efforts amid more political pressure to do so under President Trump. Feb. 5, 2025 It’s part of a broader retrenchment across the business community. About 20% of companies in the Standard \u0026 Poor’s 100 have retreated from DEI commitments since Trump was elected, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. Those include Target Corp. , McDonald’s Corp. and Disney. Trump and Elon Musk, who spent more than $200 million to help elect the president to a second term, have been vocal critics of DEI programs. In a fact sheet about Trump’s executive order, the White House said many corporations use DEI as “an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices,” sending a message to businesses that they could get sued. Companies such as Google and Amazon also contract with federal agencies. Advertisement “They’re reading the room, especially with Trump and Elon running the country,” said Chou, now the chief executive of Block Party, a tool that helps users combat online harassment. Corporate pledges to fight racism including from Musk’s company Tesla",

PCMag UK News The Best Presidents' Day Deals at Woot: Save on Apple, JBL, Google, More You get to save up to 70% at Woot heading into this three-day weekend. Celebrate the holiday with some of the biggest tech brands with even bigger price cuts. By Gabriela Vatu Feb 15, 2025 (PCMag/Woot) Presidents' Day is just around the corner, and it's a fantastic time to pick up some incredible deals on your favorite tech at Woot. Now, we need to remind you that Woot's deals are a bit different than what we see elsewhere because these discounts only last until the stock runs out or the deal expires (whichever happens first). So, let's kick things off by checking out the best early Presidents' Day we found, and don't forget to come back and check for more deals as we update this story on the reg! Woot Presidents' Day Speaker DealsWhat's tiny and super portable and it will even hook onto your backpack with the built-in carabiner? JBL Clip 5 that's been discounted by 38%, that's what. Despite its size, the speaker can get fairly loud, no matter what music you're playing. While we didn't test this exact model, we did review the previous version, the JBL Clip 4, which we found delivers great sound and has a fully waterproof design. We'd call this deal a lock! Woot Presidents' Day Earbud DealsYou know what feels great? Saving $100 on a pair of Google Pixel Buds Pro. In our review, we noted these buds deliver great audio with powerful bass and we particularly enjoyed the hands-free Google Assistant access and translation features on Android. When it comes to noise cancelation, we found the Pixel Buds Pro deliver a great experience for buds at the $200 price range, so you'll love them even more now that they're nearly half-off. If you're looking for something a bit more affordable, the JBL Endurance Peak 3 is now an amazing 60% (that's marked down to less than $40). We reviewed these earbuds and gave them an \"Excellent\" rating and felt they were also worthy of our Editors' Choice award. They deliver powerful sound with plenty of bass, they have strong battery life, and they're fully waterproof—what more could you want? \"JBL's Endurance Peak 3 earphones are a fantastic option for fitness fanatics,\" noted our expert, Tim Gideon. So run, don't walk, to grab this deal! Woot Presidents' Day Apple Watch DealsSeeing the Apple Watch Series 7 on sale always makes us happy because this is a fantastic piece of tech. In our review, we gave it an \"Outstanding\" rating and our Editors' Choice award. \"The Series 7 is Apple's most attractive and durable wearable yet,\" noted our expert, Angela Moscaritolo. She also appreciated the large display, fast charging capabilities, and the fact that it will survive quite a few bumps and drops. Swapping out the band on your Apple Watch can be rather costly, but not if you choose one of the many Solo Loops available at Woot. These are not adjustable, so you're going to have to make sure you're picking the right size. Woot has them in a multitude of colors, including shades of red and pink or blues. You'll also be able to pick the size of your Apple Watch so you can ensure it won't just fit around your wrist, but also your device. Make sure to check out our guide on picking the right Apple Watch Solo Loop band size. Woot Presidents' Day Monitor DealsUpgrading your home office? Start with this amazing Samsung ViewFinity S5 which is down to one of the best prices we've seen this year. At 34 inches, this is a fairly large monitor with a 21:9 ratio and impeccable 1440p resolution. While it may not be a gaming monitor, its 100Hz refresh rate is going to perform well enough even when you're playing your favorites. We didn't get a chance to review this particular model, but make sur",

PCMag UK News The Best Presidents' Day Deals at Woot: Save on Apple, JBL, Google, More You get to save up to 70% at Woot heading into this three-day weekend. Celebrate the holiday with some of the biggest tech brands with even bigger price cuts. By Gabriela Vatu Feb 15, 2025 (PCMag/Woot) Presidents' Day is just around the corner, and it's a fantastic time to pick up some incredible deals on your favorite tech at Woot. Now, we need to remind you that Woot's deals are a bit different than what we see elsewhere because these discounts only last until the stock runs out or the deal expires (whichever happens first). So, let's kick things off by checking out the best early Presidents' Day we found, and don't forget to come back and check for more deals as we update this story on the reg! Woot Presidents' Day Speaker DealsWhat's tiny and super portable and it will even hook onto your backpack with the built-in carabiner? JBL Clip 5 that's been discounted by 38%, that's what. Despite its size, the speaker can get fairly loud, no matter what music you're playing. While we didn't test this exact model, we did review the previous version, the JBL Clip 4, which we found delivers great sound and has a fully waterproof design. We'd call this deal a lock! Woot Presidents' Day Earbud DealsYou know what feels great? Saving $100 on a pair of Google Pixel Buds Pro. In our review, we noted these buds deliver great audio with powerful bass and we particularly enjoyed the hands-free Google Assistant access and translation features on Android. When it comes to noise cancelation, we found the Pixel Buds Pro deliver a great experience for buds at the $200 price range, so you'll love them even more now that they're nearly half-off. If you're looking for something a bit more affordable, the JBL Endurance Peak 3 is now an amazing 60% (that's marked down to less than $40). We reviewed these earbuds and gave them an \"Excellent\" rating and felt they were also worthy of our Editors' Choice award. They deliver powerful sound with plenty of bass, they have strong battery life, and they're fully waterproof—what more could you want? \"JBL's Endurance Peak 3 earphones are a fantastic option for fitness fanatics,\" noted our expert, Tim Gideon. So run, don't walk, to grab this deal! Woot Presidents' Day Apple Watch DealsSeeing the Apple Watch Series 7 on sale always makes us happy because this is a fantastic piece of tech. In our review, we gave it an \"Outstanding\" rating and our Editors' Choice award. \"The Series 7 is Apple's most attractive and durable wearable yet,\" noted our expert, Angela Moscaritolo. She also appreciated the large display, fast charging capabilities, and the fact that it will survive quite a few bumps and drops. Swapping out the band on your Apple Watch can be rather costly, but not if you choose one of the many Solo Loops available at Woot. These are not adjustable, so you're going to have to make sure you're picking the right size. Woot has them in a multitude of colors, including shades of red and pink or blues. You'll also be able to pick the size of your Apple Watch so you can ensure it won't just fit around your wrist, but also your device. Make sure to check out our guide on picking the right Apple Watch Solo Loop band size. Woot Presidents' Day Monitor DealsUpgrading your home office? Start with this amazing Samsung ViewFinity S5 which is down to one of the best prices we've seen this year. At 34 inches, this is a fairly large monitor with a 21:9 ratio and impeccable 1440p resolution. While it may not be a gaming monitor, its 100Hz refresh rate is going to perform well enough even when you're playing your favorites. We didn't get a chance to review this particular model, but make sur",

It’s like peeking into a world full of possibilities. Whether you’re a tech wizard or a marketing guru, Google has something for everyone. And guess what? You don’t have to be a genius to get in. With the right approach and a bit of determination, you could land a role at one of the most innovative companies on the planet. Let’s break down what you need to know about getting a job at Google, from the application process to the types of roles available. Key Takeaways Google offers a wide range of roles from technical to creative, catering to diverse skill sets. The hiring process involves multiple stages, including applications and interviews. Technical roles at Google include software development, data science, and engineering. Marketing and creative positions cover digital marketing, content strategy, and brand management. Google provides flexible work options, including remote and flexible schedules. Understanding the Hiring Process at Google Application and Interview Stages Getting a job at Google can be quite the adventure. The process usually kicks off with an online application, where you’ll need to submit your resume and any other required documents. Once your application is reviewed, you may be invited to a phone or video interview. This is often followed by one or more on-site interviews, which can be both technical and non-technical in nature. These stages are designed to assess not just your skills, but also how well you fit with Google’s culture. Tips for a Successful Application Tailor your resume: Make sure your resume highlights relevant experiences and skills that align with the job description. Research Google’s culture: Understand the company’s values and work environment to better align your application. Prepare for interviews: Practice common interview questions and consider using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your responses. What to Expect After Applying After submitting your application, you might feel like you’re in limbo. But don’t worry! Google typically updates candidates on their status within a few weeks. If you’re selected for an interview, you’ll receive details about the process and what to expect. If you don’t hear back immediately, it might be a good idea to follow up politely. Remember, patience is key when waiting for a response from such a large organization. The journey to landing a job at Google is not just about showcasing your technical skills, but also about demonstrating your ability to thrive in a collaborative and innovative environment. Exploring Technical Roles at Google Google is a treasure trove of technical opportunities for those eager to dive into the world of innovation and technology. Whether you’re a seasoned engineer or a budding developer, there’s a role that can fit your skills and aspirations.

It’s like peeking into a world full of possibilities. Whether you’re a tech wizard or a marketing guru, Google has something for everyone. And guess what? You don’t have to be a genius to get in. With the right approach and a bit of determination, you could land a role at one of the most innovative companies on the planet. Let’s break down what you need to know about getting a job at Google, from the application process to the types of roles available. Key Takeaways Google offers a wide range of roles from technical to creative, catering to diverse skill sets. The hiring process involves multiple stages, including applications and interviews. Technical roles at Google include software development, data science, and engineering. Marketing and creative positions cover digital marketing, content strategy, and brand management. Google provides flexible work options, including remote and flexible schedules. Understanding the Hiring Process at Google Application and Interview Stages Getting a job at Google can be quite the adventure. The process usually kicks off with an online application, where you’ll need to submit your resume and any other required documents. Once your application is reviewed, you may be invited to a phone or video interview. This is often followed by one or more on-site interviews, which can be both technical and non-technical in nature. These stages are designed to assess not just your skills, but also how well you fit with Google’s culture. Tips for a Successful Application Tailor your resume: Make sure your resume highlights relevant experiences and skills that align with the job description. Research Google’s culture: Understand the company’s values and work environment to better align your application. Prepare for interviews: Practice common interview questions and consider using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your responses. What to Expect After Applying After submitting your application, you might feel like you’re in limbo. But don’t worry! Google typically updates candidates on their status within a few weeks. If you’re selected for an interview, you’ll receive details about the process and what to expect. If you don’t hear back immediately, it might be a good idea to follow up politely. Remember, patience is key when waiting for a response from such a large organization. The journey to landing a job at Google is not just about showcasing your technical skills, but also about demonstrating your ability to thrive in a collaborative and innovative environment. Exploring Technical Roles at Google Google is a treasure trove of technical opportunities for those eager to dive into the world of innovation and technology. Whether you’re a seasoned engineer or a budding developer, there’s a role that can fit your skills and aspirations. Software Development Opportunities Software development at Google is all about building and optimizing the digital tools we rely on",

It’s like peeking into a world full of possibilities. Whether you’re a tech wizard or a marketing guru, Google has something for everyone. And guess what? You don’t have to be a genius to get in. With the right approach and a bit of determination, you could land a role at one of the most innovative companies on the planet. Let’s break down what you need to know about getting a job at Google, from the application process to the types of roles available. Key Takeaways Google offers a wide range of roles from technical to creative, catering to diverse skill sets. The hiring process involves multiple stages, including applications and interviews. Technical roles at Google include software development, data science, and engineering. Marketing and creative positions cover digital marketing, content strategy, and brand management. Google provides flexible work options, including remote and flexible schedules. Understanding the Hiring Process at Google Application and Interview Stages Getting a job at Google can be quite the adventure. The process usually kicks off with an online application, where you’ll need to submit your resume and any other required documents. Once your application is reviewed, you may be invited to a phone or video interview. This is often followed by one or more on-site interviews, which can be both technical and non-technical in nature. These stages are designed to assess not just your skills, but also how well you fit with Google’s culture. Tips for a Successful Application Tailor your resume: Make sure your resume highlights relevant experiences and skills that align with the job description. Research Google’s culture: Understand the company’s values and work environment to better align your application. Prepare for interviews: Practice common interview questions and consider using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your responses. What to Expect After Applying After submitting your application, you might feel like you’re in limbo. But don’t worry! Google typically updates candidates on their status within a few weeks. If you’re selected for an interview, you’ll receive details about the process and what to expect. If you don’t hear back immediately, it might be a good idea to follow up politely. Remember, patience is key when waiting for a response from such a large organization. The journey to landing a job at Google is not just about showcasing your technical skills, but also about demonstrating your ability to thrive in a collaborative and innovative environment. Exploring Technical Roles at Google Google is a treasure trove of technical opportunities for those eager to dive into the world of innovation and technology. Whether you’re a seasoned engineer or a budding developer, there’s a role that can fit your skills and aspirations.

When opening Google Wallet today, I noticed that a CVS membership barcode was moved up to the list so it was right underneath the top carousel. For context, I added this card years ago (in the Google Pay era). It’s badged with a new “Upgrade available” label, with a card underneath the full barcode explaining how you can “Get pass updates, related passes, and messages. ” The “Upgrade pass” screen explains what benefits you’ll get: Automatic pass updates like changes in reward points Related passes like offers or coupons Messages from CVS Health The “Upgrade” button in the bottom-right corner takes you to a CVS website to sign-up. Back in October, the release notes for Google Play services explained how: “You’ll now be able to upgrade your passes in Google Wallet. ” As such, this feature looks through your existing, static passes and sees how they can be modernized. This saves you from manually going to the Add to Wallet FAB \u003e Loyalty card. If you dismiss the “Upgrade” card, you can access it again from the three-dot overflow menu.

When opening Google Wallet today, I noticed that a CVS membership barcode was moved up to the list so it was right underneath the top carousel. For context, I added this card years ago (in the Google Pay era). It’s badged with a new “Upgrade available” label, with a card underneath the full barcode explaining how you can “Get pass updates, related passes, and messages. ” The “Upgrade pass” screen explains what benefits you’ll get: Automatic pass updates like changes in reward points Related passes like offers or coupons Messages from CVS Health The “Upgrade” button in the bottom-right corner takes you to a CVS website to sign-up. Back in October, the release notes for Google Play services explained how: “You’ll now be able to upgrade your passes in Google Wallet. ” As such, this feature looks through your existing, static passes and sees how they can be modernized. This saves you from manually going to the Add to Wallet FAB \u003e Loyalty card. If you dismiss the “Upgrade” card, you can access it again from the three-dot overflow menu.

When opening Google Wallet today, I noticed that a CVS membership barcode was moved up to the list so it was right underneath the top carousel. For context, I added this card years ago (in the Google Pay era). It’s badged with a new “Upgrade available” label, with a card underneath the full barcode explaining how you can “Get pass updates, related passes, and messages. ” The “Upgrade pass” screen explains what benefits you’ll get: Automatic pass updates like changes in reward points Related passes like offers or coupons Messages from CVS Health The “Upgrade” button in the bottom-right corner takes you to a CVS website to sign-up. Back in October, the release notes for Google Play services explained how: “You’ll now be able to upgrade your passes in Google Wallet. ” As such, this feature looks through your existing, static passes and sees how they can be modernized. This saves you from manually going to the Add to Wallet FAB \u003e Loyalty card. If you dismiss the “Upgrade” card, you can access it again from the three-dot overflow menu.

When opening Google Wallet today, I noticed that a CVS membership barcode was moved up to the list so it was right underneath the top carousel. For context, I added this card years ago (in the Google Pay era). It’s badged with a new “Upgrade available” label, with a card underneath the full barcode explaining how you can “Get pass updates, related passes, and messages. ” The “Upgrade pass” screen explains what benefits you’ll get: Automatic pass updates like changes in reward points Related passes like offers or coupons Messages from CVS Health The “Upgrade” button in the bottom-right corner takes you to a CVS website to sign-up. Back in October, the release notes for Google Play services explained how: “You’ll now be able to upgrade your passes in Google Wallet. ” As such, this feature looks through your existing, static passes and sees how they can be modernized. This saves you from manually going to the Add to Wallet FAB \u003e Loyalty card. If you dismiss the “Upgrade” card, you can access it again from the three-dot overflow menu.

PCMag UK News The Best Last Minute Presidents' Day Deals at Woot: Save on Apple, JBL, Google, More You get to save up to 70% at Woot this holiday. Celebrate with some of the biggest tech brands with even bigger price cuts. PCMag UK Feb 17, 2025 (PCMag/Woot) Presidents' Day is nearly over, and it's still a fantastic time to pick up some incredible deals on your favorite tech at Woot. Now, we need to remind you that Woot's deals are a bit different than what we see elsewhere because these discounts only last until the stock runs out or the deal expires (whichever happens first). So, let's kick things off by checking out the best Presidents' Day we found at Woot. And don't forget to check out our round-up of the Best Presidents' Day Tech Deals. Woot Presidents' Day Speaker DealsWhat's tiny and super portable and it will even hook onto your backpack with the built-in carabiner? JBL Clip 5 that's been discounted by 38%, that's what. Despite its size, the speaker can get fairly loud, no matter what music you're playing. While we didn't test this exact model, we did review the previous version, the JBL Clip 4, which we found delivers great sound and has a fully waterproof design. We'd call this deal a lock! Woot Presidents' Day Earbud DealsYou know what feels great? Saving $100 on a pair of Google Pixel Buds Pro. In our review, we noted these buds deliver great audio with powerful bass and we particularly enjoyed the hands-free Google Assistant access and translation features on Android. When it comes to noise cancelation, we found the Pixel Buds Pro deliver a great experience for buds at the $200 price range, so you'll love them even more now that they're nearly half-off. If you're looking for something a bit more affordable, the JBL Endurance Peak 3 is now an amazing 60% (that's marked down to less than $40). We reviewed these earbuds and gave them an \"Excellent\" rating and felt they were also worthy of our Editors' Choice award. They deliver powerful sound with plenty of bass, they have strong battery life, and they're fully waterproof—what more could you want? \"JBL's Endurance Peak 3 earphones are a fantastic option for fitness fanatics,\" noted our expert, Tim Gideon. So run, don't walk, to grab this deal! If you like your earbuds with a bit of AI, then the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 should be on your radar, especially now that they're 33% off. Our expert, Christian de Looper noted these buds are more comfortable and easier to control than older Samsung models and the noise cancellation is surprisingly good. In our review, he also mentions the battery life is not great at all, but if you don't mind charging them often, you're good to go. If you have a Samsung phone, Galaxy AI will translate conversations for you on the go, which is pretty handy if you travel often. Woot Presidents' Day Headphones DealsIf you'd rather get over the ear headphones, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 offer a stylish design, a comfortable build, and 60 hours of battery life. In our review we rated these as \"Excellent\" for their great audio performance and robust bass. They \"deliver a wonderful audio experience and high-quality active noise cancellation at a fittingly high price,\" says our expert Tim Gideon. Well, that high price is now low, low, low with a $210 price cut. Woot Presidents' Day Apple Watch DealsSeeing the Apple Watch Series 7 on sale always makes us happy because this is a fantastic piece of tech. In our review, we gave it an \"Outstanding\" rating and our Editors' Choice award. \"The Series 7 is Apple's most attractive and durable wearable yet,\" noted our expert, Angela Moscaritolo. She also appreciated the large display, fast charging capabilities, and the fact that it will survive quite ",

PCMag UK News The Best Last Minute Presidents' Day Deals at Woot: Save on Apple, JBL, Google, More You get to save up to 70% at Woot this holiday. Celebrate with some of the biggest tech brands with even bigger price cuts. PCMag UK Feb 17, 2025 (PCMag/Woot) Presidents' Day is nearly over, and it's still a fantastic time to pick up some incredible deals on your favorite tech at Woot. Now, we need to remind you that Woot's deals are a bit different than what we see elsewhere because these discounts only last until the stock runs out or the deal expires (whichever happens first). So, let's kick things off by checking out the best Presidents' Day we found at Woot. And don't forget to check out our round-up of the Best Presidents' Day Tech Deals. Woot Presidents' Day Speaker DealsWhat's tiny and super portable and it will even hook onto your backpack with the built-in carabiner? JBL Clip 5 that's been discounted by 38%, that's what. Despite its size, the speaker can get fairly loud, no matter what music you're playing. While we didn't test this exact model, we did review the previous version, the JBL Clip 4, which we found delivers great sound and has a fully waterproof design. We'd call this deal a lock! Woot Presidents' Day Earbud DealsYou know what feels great? Saving $100 on a pair of Google Pixel Buds Pro. In our review, we noted these buds deliver great audio with powerful bass and we particularly enjoyed the hands-free Google Assistant access and translation features on Android. When it comes to noise cancelation, we found the Pixel Buds Pro deliver a great experience for buds at the $200 price range, so you'll love them even more now that they're nearly half-off. If you're looking for something a bit more affordable, the JBL Endurance Peak 3 is now an amazing 60% (that's marked down to less than $40). We reviewed these earbuds and gave them an \"Excellent\" rating and felt they were also worthy of our Editors' Choice award. They deliver powerful sound with plenty of bass, they have strong battery life, and they're fully waterproof—what more could you want? \"JBL's Endurance Peak 3 earphones are a fantastic option for fitness fanatics,\" noted our expert, Tim Gideon. So run, don't walk, to grab this deal! If you like your earbuds with a bit of AI, then the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 should be on your radar, especially now that they're 33% off. Our expert, Christian de Looper noted these buds are more comfortable and easier to control than older Samsung models and the noise cancellation is surprisingly good. In our review, he also mentions the battery life is not great at all, but if you don't mind charging them often, you're good to go. If you have a Samsung phone, Galaxy AI will translate conversations for you on the go, which is pretty handy if you travel often. Woot Presidents' Day Headphones DealsIf you'd rather get over the ear headphones, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 offer a stylish design, a comfortable build, and 60 hours of battery life. In our review we rated these as \"Excellent\" for their great audio performance and robust bass. They \"deliver a wonderful audio experience and high-quality active noise cancellation at a fittingly high price,\" says our expert Tim Gideon. Well, that high price is now low, low, low with a $210 price cut. Woot Presidents' Day Apple Watch DealsSeeing the Apple Watch Series 7 on sale always makes us happy because this is a fantastic piece of tech. In our review, we gave it an \"Outstanding\" rating and our Editors' Choice award. \"The Series 7 is Apple's most attractive and durable wearable yet,\" noted our expert, Angela Moscaritolo. She also appreciated the large display, fast charging capabilities, and the fact that it will survive quite ",

Google today sent a “February Newsletter” to Gemini Advanced subscribers, with Google AI Premium being $19. 99 per month. It starts by recapping the recent Experimental model launches, and differentiates them as such: Gemini 2. 0 Pro Experimental: “Our leading model designed for this new era of AI, providing better factuality and exceptional performance for coding and math prompts. 2. 0 Pro Experimental will help you navigate the most complex tasks with greater ease and accuracy. ” Gemini 2. 0 Flash Thinking: “Built on the speed and performance of 2. 0 Flash, this experimental model transparently showcases its thought process in real time. Expand to see why it responded a certain way, its assumptions, and trace the reasoning. ” It also highlights last week’s launch of recall in the Gemini app and NotebookLM Premium. New in this Gemini Advanced email is a tease about “More exciting updates are on the horizon,” specifically “in the coming months. ” The subscription is referred to as “your pass to Google’s next-gen AI,” so these bullet points might be referring to more than just the Gemini app. “Explore new ways to create with leading video, image, and audio generation tools. ” The Gemini app already provides access to Imagen 3, which last updated in January, while Veo 2 is behind a Google Labs waitlist. Audio generation is presumably referring to MusicLM and/or Lyria. It would be interesting if Gemini Advanced provided priority access to those standalone or Gemini-integrated tools. “Be more productive with agentic tools that can take action on your behalf, freeing you up to spend your time how you want. ” In terms of agentic tools there’s Project Mariner, which CEO Sundar Pichai previously said would come to the Gemini app in some form this year. Other agentic features could be in Google Workspace, with I/O 2024 featuring a demo about how you could “ask Gemini to automatically organize email attachments in Drive, generate a sheet with the data and then analyze it with Data Q\u0026A. ” “Tackle even more complex projects with new model upgrades and access to experimental models built to deliver improved performance. ” The last point is more straightforward with Gemini 2. 0 Pro eventually hitting stable and becoming the default model for Advanced subscribers. It will be interesting to see how Gemini 2. 0 Flash Thinking gets presented to end users. Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Written by Artie Beaty, Contributing Writer Feb. 19, 2025 at 8:52 a. m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro ZDNETFocusing on the most important information in your work call is about to get a little easier. Google is rolling out a pair of new features for Meet today -- one that will help you catch up on missed information and one that will help you plan for what to do after the meeting. Expanded caption history First up is a significant change to how live captions work. At present, Google says, captions display in real time but go away once they're \"no longer relevant to the current conversation. \" With this change, you'll be able to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of live captions. There's a \"Jump to the bottom\" button to go back to what's happening currently. This is especially useful if you're late to the meeting and want to catch up or want to reference specific details from earlier in the meeting. Also: How to use Gemini's Deep Research to browse the web faster and better AI-generated 'Next Steps' GoogleAlso new is a \"Next Steps\" feature, an expansion of the \"Take Notes for me\" feature that rolled out last fall.",

Written by Artie Beaty, Contributing Writer Feb. 19, 2025 at 8:52 a. m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro ZDNETFocusing on the most important information in your work call is about to get a little easier. Google is rolling out a pair of new features for Meet today -- one that will help you catch up on missed information and one that will help you plan for what to do after the meeting. Expanded caption history First up is a significant change to how live captions work. At present, Google says, captions display in real time but go away once they're \"no longer relevant to the current conversation. \" With this change, you'll be able to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of live captions. There's a \"Jump to the bottom\" button to go back to what's happening currently. This is especially useful if you're late to the meeting and want to catch up or want to reference specific details from earlier in the meeting.

In a short support post today, the company announced how “Google Photos is expanding the group of eligible devices where you can display albums in a slideshow on the ambient or idle screen of your device. ” The new supported form factors are: Smart TVs, Tablets, Fridges, and Photo frames. The existing list includes: Google TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Pixel Tablet, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max. These devices offer a Google-built slideshow experience that can be controlled via the Google Photos app (Settings \u003e Apps \u0026 devices \u003e Photo frames). It can also be set via the Google Home app. It now seems like something similar will be coming to third-party devices. Some smart fridges already offer Google Photos integration, while bringing Google Photos to non-Android/Google TV sets is a good idea and dedicated photo frame devices are always popular. Google today is not announcing any of the new devices or integrations.

In a short support post today, the company announced how “Google Photos is expanding the group of eligible devices where you can display albums in a slideshow on the ambient or idle screen of your device. ” The new supported form factors are: Smart TVs, Tablets, Fridges, and Photo frames. The existing list includes: Google TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Pixel Tablet, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max. These devices offer a Google-built slideshow experience that can be controlled via the Google Photos app (Settings \u003e Apps \u0026 devices \u003e Photo frames). It can also be set via the Google Home app. It now seems like something similar will be coming to third-party devices. Some smart fridges already offer Google Photos integration, while bringing Google Photos to non-Android/Google TV sets is a good idea and dedicated photo frame devices are always popular. Google today is not announcing any of the new devices or integrations.

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support — from launch — of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer’s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won’t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it’s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup — from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee – that includes returns during that period – customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a “used” smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms – so it isn’t necessarily “better” in every instance. If you’re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon’s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google’s own “Certified Refurbished Pixel Phones” program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 – giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It’s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support — from launch — of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer’s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won’t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it’s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup — from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee – that includes returns during that period – customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a “used” smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms – so it isn’t necessarily “better” in every instance. If you’re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon’s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google’s own “Certified Refurbished Pixel Phones” program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 – giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It’s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support — from launch — of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer’s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won’t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it’s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup — from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee – that includes returns during that period – customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a “used” smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms – so it isn’t necessarily “better” in every instance. If you’re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon’s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google’s own “Certified Refurbished Pixel Phones” program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 – giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It’s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support — from launch — of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer’s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won’t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it’s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup — from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee – that includes returns during that period – customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a “used” smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms – so it isn’t necessarily “better” in every instance. If you’re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon’s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google’s own “Certified Refurbished Pixel Phones” program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 – giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It’s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.
