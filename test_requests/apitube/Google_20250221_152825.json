President Claudia Sheinbaum shared a letter that says Google will not change the policy it outlined after U. S. President Trump declared the Gulf of Mexico be changed to the Gulf of America. Google Maps recently made the name change in which the body of water appears as the Gulf of America in the United States but remains the Gulf of Mexico in Mexico. Outsider countries can see both names. Mexico has argued that the mapping policy violates Mexican sovereignty because the U. S. only has jurisdiction over around 46% of the gulf. The rest is controlled by Mexico with 49% and Cuba controls around 5%. Mexican authorities said they will take legal action depending on Google’s response. They said, “Under no circumstance will mexico accept the renaming of a geographic zone within its own territory and under its jurisdiction. ” FacebookTwitterPinterest Related Posts First Strides Program To Kick Off In North Myrtle Beach Protesters Demonstrate Outside Myrtle Beach City Hall North Myrtle Beach Leaders Discuss Multi-Million Dollar Home Project Most Popular Build Your Dream Sunroom with Sunspace of Myrtle BeachCollision Involving A Train Claims The Life Of One ManTransform Your Home with Help from FT Kitchen \u0026 BathPerson Taken Into Custody After Crash In The Market Common AreaHome Care Helpers USA Offering 2025 Family Caregiver Scholarship Weather What's On The Latest FOX News Not the News Watch Live Weather Myrtle Beach, SC Florence, SC Lumberton, NC Radar Hurricane Tracker Sports Panthers Pikes Peak NASCAR Hornets Contests User Submission WFXB – Contact Us Our Team Advertise Jobs Closed Captioning Schedule FOX On Demand MeTV Privacy Policy Terms of Use EEO Reports Public File FCC Applications © 2025 WFXB.

Google Gemini features will no longer be available in the iOS Google app. As AndroidCentral spotted, the company emailed Gemini users to highlight this change. “We’re making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS,” the email said. “Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini. To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store. ”This change occurred because Google wants to prioritize the Google Gemini app for iOS instead of needing to maintain Gemini features in multiple apps. Since the company released a proper Gemini app late last year, it’s only natural that the company is focusing on it. In the aforementioned email, Google highlights all the main features users can take advantage of in the Gemini app, including: Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

If you try to use Google Gemini features under the Google app, there’s a new screen that shows “Gemini has its own app. Download the Gemini app for iPhone. ” That said, it’s likely that the company will soon remove references to its AI from its main app in the near future. Even though Gemini isn’t fully integrated with Apple Intelligence, as ChatGPT is, iPhone 15 Pro users or newer can integrate the Gemini experience with the Action Button and other shortcuts.

PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro ZDNETFocusing on the most important information in your work call is about to get a little easier. Google is rolling out a pair of new features for Meet today -- one that will help you catch up on missed information and one that will help you plan for what to do after the meeting. Expanded caption history First up is a significant change to how live captions work. At present, Google says, captions display in real time but go away once they're \"no longer relevant to the current conversation. \" With this change, you'll be able to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of live captions. There's a \"Jump to the bottom\" button to go back to what's happening currently. This is especially useful if you're late to the meeting and want to catch up or want to reference specific details from earlier in the meeting.

Written by Artie Beaty, Contributing Writer Feb. 19, 2025 at 8:52 a. m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro ZDNETFocusing on the most important information in your work call is about to get a little easier. Google is rolling out a pair of new features for Meet today -- one that will help you catch up on missed information and one that will help you plan for what to do after the meeting. Expanded caption history First up is a significant change to how live captions work. At present, Google says, captions display in real time but go away once they're \"no longer relevant to the current conversation. \" With this change, you'll be able to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of live captions. There's a \"Jump to the bottom\" button to go back to what's happening currently. This is especially useful if you're late to the meeting and want to catch up or want to reference specific details from earlier in the meeting.

When Google unveiled Circle to Search in early 2024, I said I wanted a similar feature on the iPhone. More than a year later, Circle to Search is available on plenty of Galaxy, Pixel, and other Android phones, where Google controls the underlying operating system. But Circle to Search can’t come to the iPhone in the same way that it works on Android. However, Google on Wednesday launched the next best thing for iPhones. It’s called “Search Screen with Google Lens” instead of Circle to Search, but it works in a similar way. The feature is available inside the Google and Chrome apps on the iPhone, but it also supports gestures that are similar to Circle to Search. Unfortunately, invoking the iPhone version of Circle to Search isn’t as simple as using it on Android devices. Before drawing, highlighting, or tapping an item on a page to initiate a Google Search, you’ll have to go through additional steps, making the feature less exciting to use. You’ll need to tap the three-dot menu and then select the “Search Screen with Google Lens” option to initiate searches. The same procedure applies to both the Chrome and Google apps. In the future, a Lens icon will appear in the address bar in Chrome, similar to the Lens experience for the desktop version of the browser. Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Performing a “Search Screen with Google Lens” in the Google app on iPhone. Image source: GoogleThe feature won’t work outside these two apps, which is another big difference. You can invoke Circle to Search anywhere on the screen on Android because it’s Google’s operating system. Google doesn’t have the same freedom in iOS. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll quickly be able to use this new gesture for the iPhone to find out more details about anything you stumble upon online. The new screen search functionality is rolling out this week, and it’ll be available globally to iPhone users with Chrome and the Google app installed. Google also announced a Google Lens feature I’m not too excited about: AI Overviews will begin to appear “more often” in Lens results. You cannot opt out of this, as Google will gradually introduce it to more Lens experiences. AI Overviews in Lens will be available initially to English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are already available in Google Search. Initially, it will be confined to the Google app on iPhone and Android, but the Chrome mobile and desktop apps will also get it.

TRENDING: iOS 18 iPhone 16 Apple Watch Battery Life M4 MacBook Pro AirPods Max 2 watchOS 11 Apple One Reset AirPods iPad sideloading Home Tech Apps \u0026 Software Google Lens brings Circle to Search to iPhone… sort of By Chris Smith Published Feb 19th, 2025 12:00PM EST Image: Samsung If you buy through a BGR link, we may earn an affiliate commission, helping support our expert product labs. When Google unveiled Circle to Search in early 2024, I said I wanted a similar feature on the iPhone. More than a year later, Circle to Search is available on plenty of Galaxy, Pixel, and other Android phones, where Google controls the underlying operating system. But Circle to Search can’t come to the iPhone in the same way that it works on Android. However, Google on Wednesday launched the next best thing for iPhones. It’s called “Search Screen with Google Lens” instead of Circle to Search, but it works in a similar way. The feature is available inside the Google and Chrome apps on the iPhone, but it also supports gestures that are similar to Circle to Search. Unfortunately, invoking the iPhone version of Circle to Search isn’t as simple as using it on Android devices. Before drawing, highlighting, or tapping an item on a page to initiate a Google Search, you’ll have to go through additional steps, making the feature less exciting to use. You’ll need to tap the three-dot menu and then select the “Search Screen with Google Lens” option to initiate searches. The same procedure applies to both the Chrome and Google apps. In the future, a Lens icon will appear in the address bar in Chrome, similar to the Lens experience for the desktop version of the browser. Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Performing a “Search Screen with Google Lens” in the Google app on iPhone. Image source: GoogleThe feature won’t work outside these two apps, which is another big difference. You can invoke Circle to Search anywhere on the screen on Android because it’s Google’s operating system. Google doesn’t have the same freedom in iOS. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll quickly be able to use this new gesture for the iPhone to find out more details about anything you stumble upon online. The new screen search functionality is rolling out this week, and it’ll be available globally to iPhone users with Chrome and the Google app installed. Google also announced a Google Lens feature I’m not too excited about: AI Overviews will begin to appear “more often” in Lens results. You cannot opt out of this, as Google will gradually introduce it to more Lens experiences. AI Overviews in Lens will be available initially to English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are already available in Google Search. Initially, it will be confined to the Google app on iPhone and Android, but the Chrome mobile and desktop apps will also get it.

Unfortunately, invoking the iPhone version of Circle to Search isn’t as simple as using it on Android devices. Before drawing, highlighting, or tapping an item on a page to initiate a Google Search, you’ll have to go through additional steps, making the feature less exciting to use. You’ll need to tap the three-dot menu and then select the “Search Screen with Google Lens” option to initiate searches. The same procedure applies to both the Chrome and Google apps. In the future, a Lens icon will appear in the address bar in Chrome, similar to the Lens experience for the desktop version of the browser. Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Performing a “Search Screen with Google Lens” in the Google app on iPhone. Image source: GoogleThe feature won’t work outside these two apps, which is another big difference. You can invoke Circle to Search anywhere on the screen on Android because it’s Google’s operating system. Google doesn’t have the same freedom in iOS. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll quickly be able to use this new gesture for the iPhone to find out more details about anything you stumble upon online. The new screen search functionality is rolling out this week, and it’ll be available globally to iPhone users with Chrome and the Google app installed. Google also announced a Google Lens feature I’m not too excited about: AI Overviews will begin to appear “more often” in Lens results. You cannot opt out of this, as Google will gradually introduce it to more Lens experiences. AI Overviews in Lens will be available initially to English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are already available in Google Search. Initially, it will be confined to the Google app on iPhone and Android, but the Chrome mobile and desktop apps will also get it.

Meanwhile, Google Lens can now recognize more unique images. Chrome on the iPhone and iPad already has an instance of Lens that lets you take a picture or analyze a screenshot. You can now “Search Screen with Google Lens” as you’re browsing the web or watching a video. Instead of manually taking a screenshot, you’ll find that new shortcut in the three-dot overflow menu. A shimmer will appear over the screen and you’ll be prompted to “Circle or tap anywhere to search. ” (You can also highlight text. ) Web results, including AI Overviews, appear in a bottom sheet, with pages opening a new tab. This is essentially Android’s Circle to Search capability, and also coming to the Google app on iOS as “Search this Screen” in the three-dot menu (top-right corner). Google Lens Screen Search is rolling out now with Chrome 133 for iOS and the latest version of the Google (Search) app. Meanwhile, Google credits “advanced AI models” as allowing Lens to “go much further and provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images. ” Results will take the form of AI Overviews, with the expanded recognition meaning that users don’t need to manually append a question. Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood. Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. Expanded recognition is rolling out this week for “English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available. ” You’ll first see this with the Google app on Android and iOS before coming to the desktop and mobile Chrome version.

Meanwhile, Google Lens can now recognize more unique images. Chrome on the iPhone and iPad already has an instance of Lens that lets you take a picture or analyze a screenshot. You can now “Search Screen with Google Lens” as you’re browsing the web or watching a video. Instead of manually taking a screenshot, you’ll find that new shortcut in the three-dot overflow menu. A shimmer will appear over the screen and you’ll be prompted to “Circle or tap anywhere to search. ” (You can also highlight text. ) Web results, including AI Overviews, appear in a bottom sheet, with pages opening a new tab. This is essentially Android’s Circle to Search capability, and also coming to the Google app on iOS as “Search this Screen” in the three-dot menu (top-right corner). Google Lens Screen Search is rolling out now with Chrome 133 for iOS and the latest version of the Google (Search) app. Meanwhile, Google credits “advanced AI models” as allowing Lens to “go much further and provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images. ” Results will take the form of AI Overviews, with the expanded recognition meaning that users don’t need to manually append a question. Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood. Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. Expanded recognition is rolling out this week for “English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available. ” You’ll first see this with the Google app on Android and iOS before coming to the desktop and mobile Chrome version.

Meanwhile, Google Lens can now recognize more unique images. Chrome on the iPhone and iPad already has an instance of Lens that lets you take a picture or analyze a screenshot. You can now “Search Screen with Google Lens” as you’re browsing the web or watching a video. Instead of manually taking a screenshot, you’ll find that new shortcut in the three-dot overflow menu. A shimmer will appear over the screen and you’ll be prompted to “Circle or tap anywhere to search. ” (You can also highlight text. ) Web results, including AI Overviews, appear in a bottom sheet, with pages opening a new tab. This is essentially Android’s Circle to Search capability, and also coming to the Google app on iOS as “Search this Screen” in the three-dot menu (top-right corner). Google Lens Screen Search is rolling out now with Chrome 133 for iOS and the latest version of the Google (Search) app. Meanwhile, Google credits “advanced AI models” as allowing Lens to “go much further and provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images. ” Results will take the form of AI Overviews, with the expanded recognition meaning that users don’t need to manually append a question. Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood. Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. Expanded recognition is rolling out this week for “English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available. ” You’ll first see this with the Google app on Android and iOS before coming to the desktop and mobile Chrome version.

Meanwhile, Google Lens can now recognize more unique images. Chrome on the iPhone and iPad already has an instance of Lens that lets you take a picture or analyze a screenshot. You can now “Search Screen with Google Lens” as you’re browsing the web or watching a video. Instead of manually taking a screenshot, you’ll find that new shortcut in the three-dot overflow menu. A shimmer will appear over the screen and you’ll be prompted to “Circle or tap anywhere to search. ” (You can also highlight text. ) Web results, including AI Overviews, appear in a bottom sheet, with pages opening a new tab. This is essentially Android’s Circle to Search capability, and also coming to the Google app on iOS as “Search this Screen” in the three-dot menu (top-right corner). Google Lens Screen Search is rolling out now with Chrome 133 for iOS and the latest version of the Google (Search) app. Meanwhile, Google credits “advanced AI models” as allowing Lens to “go much further and provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images. ” Results will take the form of AI Overviews, with the expanded recognition meaning that users don’t need to manually append a question. Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood. Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. Expanded recognition is rolling out this week for “English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available. ” You’ll first see this with the Google app on Android and iOS before coming to the desktop and mobile Chrome version.

PCMag UK NewsMobile Phones Google Lens Update Lets You 'Search Your Screen' on iPhones The feature appears to be a limited version of Android's Circle to Search, contained within a few apps. Will it convince some Apple lovers to jump ship, or at least ditch Safari? By Emily Forlini Feb 19, 2025 (Credit: Google) Google is rolling out a new search experience this week for iOS, which lets iPhone users look up information about a portion of their screen with AI. Google Lens can already perform searches with photos. This new functionality adds the ability to search a visual on the screen—not from a new photo. It's helpful if you're reading about one topic, but something else pops up on the screen that you want a quick explanation of without having to start a disruptive new search. \"Whether you’re reading an article, shopping for a product, or watching a video, you can use this feature to quickly perform a visual search while browsing, without having to take a screenshot or open a new tab,\" says Google. It's only available within Chrome and Google on iOS, and it's a part of the Lens functionality. To try it, tap the three-dot menu in Lens and select \"Search this Screen. \" Then, you can highlight a portion of the screen by \"using whatever gesture comes naturally,\" such as drawing a circle around it or tapping it. Google Lens AI Overviews(Credit: Google)It could be considered a limited version of Google's Circle to Search feature, which debuted in January 2024 and is available on select Android devices. That feature allows you to search what's on the screen within any app, not just the Chrome or Google apps. So iPhone users are getting a taste of the Android life, but only if they choose to ditch Safari and use the Chrome or Google app. Thanks to Google's \"advanced AI models,\" Lens can provide more information about more images, even obscure ones, than ever. It surfaces the information in the same format as the AI Overviews that have lived at the top of the typical Google search results page since last May. Like AI Overviews, it's only available for English-language users and in eligible countries. \"Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood,\" Google says. \"Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. \"The latest image search capabilities from Apple came with December's iOS 18. 2 update. Now, iPhone 16 owners can press the Camera Control button, snap a picture of an object, and look up information about it with Apple Intelligence. iPhone 16 Camera Control button(Credit: Emily Forlini) More Inside PCMag. com Apple Debuts $599 iPhone 16e With Its First Custom Modem How to Quickly Launch Apps on Your Android Phone With Back-Tap 5 Major Changes I Expect for the Apple iPhone SE 4 Indoors and in Cars: How Globalstar Plans to Upgrade iPhone Satellite Features 5 Tips to Boost Your Android Phone's Battery Life About Emily Forlini My ExpertiseI'm the expert at PCMag for all things electric vehicles and AI.

Opening Google Assistant Settings \u003e Music reveals Amazon Music as an available service. It joins YouTube Music, Spotify, iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Deezer in the US. (On a related note, Google has widely rolled out a small tweak to Assistant settings on Android. The search bar is now pill-shaped and the background is slightly darker. This has been slowly rolling out in recent months. ) Old vs. new You can get specific songs, albums or artists along with music based on genre, mood, or activity, Amazon Music’s curated playlists, and your personal playlists. Tapping has you “link your Google Account with your Amazon Music Account. ” Google notes how an “Amazon Music subscription is required to play music using speakers and displays,” while the following “Advanced voice commands” are available: To do this:Say “Hey Google,” then:Play your liked songs from your Amazon Music library“Play my songs” or “Play my library”Play playlistPlay playlist pre-shuffled“Play New Music Daily” or “Play “”Shuffle New Music Daily” or “Play on shuffle”Play personal playlistShuffle personal playlist“Play [named playlist]””Shuffle [named playlist]”Play previous song“Back” or “Previous”Skip forward“Skip forward [X] seconds”Shuffle“Shuffle”Repeat song“Play it again” or “Play this song again”Play playlist in a loop“Repeat on” or “Repeat off” This started rolling out in December, while Google’s support article made note of it in January-February.

The company describes the tool as an AI co-scientist. It’s powered by Gemini 2. 0, the latest iteration of Google’s flagship large language model family. The LLMs in the series can process multimodal data and have a tool use feature, which allows them to perform actions in external systems such as databases. Researchers interact with Google’s AI co-scientist through a chatbot interface. The user specifies a goal, such as finding new clinical applications for an existing medicine, and the tool suggests potential ways of realizing that goal. The software generates a multi-paragraph research plan and finds academic papers with data relevant to the project. Users can customize the co-scientist’s output in various ways. Instead of simply providing a research goal, a scientist could enter a proposal for reaching that goal and ask the AI to review the idea. Additionally, users can provide feedback on the co-scientist’s initial prompt response to help it make improvements. “Beyond standard literature review, summarization and ‘deep research’ tools, the AI co-scientist system is intended to uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals,” Google researchers Juraj Gottweis and Vivek Natarajan wrote in a blog post. Under the hood, the AI co-scientist is powered by more than a half dozen AI agents. Those are machine learning programs that can perform actions with a high degree of autonomy. Each one carries out a different subset of the tasks involved in generating a research plan. The first agent, dubbed Generation, analyzes the scientific phenomenon the user wishes to study and generates several hypotheses that attempt to explain it. A second agent called Ranking then refines those hypotheses with the help of several auxiliary AI agents. One of the auxiliary agents, Proximity, removes duplicate research ideas. Another reviews the remaining research proposals with the help of publicly available scientific data. There’s also a third agent, dubbed Evolution, that can simplify the AI co-scientist’s output to make it easier to understand. The system uses an approach called test-time compute to generate hypotheses. The technique makes it possible to increase the quality of an AI model’s output by boosting the amount of time and infrastructure it invests in generating prompt responses. Besides the Gemini 2. 0 LLM series on which the co-scientist is based, test-time compute is also supported by several competing models including OpenAI’s o1. The agents the co-scientist uses to perform research are coordinated by a supervisor agent. According to Google, one of its responsibilities is collecting statistics about the computations involved in processing a user prompt. Those statistics help the co-scientist determine when it should end processing and display its prompt response. To test the co-scientist’s capabilities, Google asked a group of scientists to present the system with 15 research goals. The participants determined that the AI’s responses “have higher potential for novelty and impact” than the output of competing models. Google is also applying its Gemini models to other complex, domain-specific tasks. Last May, the search giant introduced Med-Gemini, a version of the LLM series fine-tuned on healthcare data. The models in the lineup can analyze x-rays and answer clinical questions using information from academic papers.

The company describes the tool as an AI co-scientist. It’s powered by Gemini 2. 0, the latest iteration of Google’s flagship large language model family. The LLMs in the series can process multimodal data and have a tool use feature, which allows them to perform actions in external systems such as databases. Researchers interact with Google’s AI co-scientist through a chatbot interface. The user specifies a goal, such as finding new clinical applications for an existing medicine, and the tool suggests potential ways of realizing that goal. The software generates a multi-paragraph research plan and finds academic papers with data relevant to the project. Users can customize the co-scientist’s output in various ways. Instead of simply providing a research goal, a scientist could enter a proposal for reaching that goal and ask the AI to review the idea. Additionally, users can provide feedback on the co-scientist’s initial prompt response to help it make improvements. “Beyond standard literature review, summarization and ‘deep research’ tools, the AI co-scientist system is intended to uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals,” Google researchers Juraj Gottweis and Vivek Natarajan wrote in a blog post. Under the hood, the AI co-scientist is powered by more than a half dozen AI agents. Those are machine learning programs that can perform actions with a high degree of autonomy. Each one carries out a different subset of the tasks involved in generating a research plan. The first agent, dubbed Generation, analyzes the scientific phenomenon the user wishes to study and generates several hypotheses that attempt to explain it. A second agent called Ranking then refines those hypotheses with the help of several auxiliary AI agents. One of the auxiliary agents, Proximity, removes duplicate research ideas. Another reviews the remaining research proposals with the help of publicly available scientific data. There’s also a third agent, dubbed Evolution, that can simplify the AI co-scientist’s output to make it easier to understand. The system uses an approach called test-time compute to generate hypotheses. The technique makes it possible to increase the quality of an AI model’s output by boosting the amount of time and infrastructure it invests in generating prompt responses. Besides the Gemini 2. 0 LLM series on which the co-scientist is based, test-time compute is also supported by several competing models including OpenAI’s o1. The agents the co-scientist uses to perform research are coordinated by a supervisor agent. According to Google, one of its responsibilities is collecting statistics about the computations involved in processing a user prompt. Those statistics help the co-scientist determine when it should end processing and display its prompt response. To test the co-scientist’s capabilities, Google asked a group of scientists to present the system with 15 research goals. The participants determined that the AI’s responses “have higher potential for novelty and impact” than the output of competing models. Google is also applying its Gemini models to other complex, domain-specific tasks. Last May, the search giant introduced Med-Gemini, a version of the LLM series fine-tuned on healthcare data. The models in the lineup can analyze x-rays and answer clinical questions using information from academic papers.

These dates go back several years as seen in the (left) screenshot below, so Google Tasks has been storing this information from the beginning. This is a nice quality-of-life improvement for checking when you recently accomplished something, especially reminders without due dates. It’s a small step towards making Google Tasks less of a basic to-do app. As of today, completed dates are appearing in the standalone Google Tasks for Android and iOS (which has yet to be redesigned). It’s not currently available for the integrated Google Calendar experience on the web and Android. Meanwhile, Google is testing a count of uncompleted tasks next to list names in the top tab switcher. This vertical pill-shaped container appears on everything but your current list. We’re only seeing this on one device, and it’s a bit distracting. Given the prominence, it feels more like a notice for tasks that have missed their due date. The option to disable this would be nice, with the app today only offering settings for Notifications and Theme. Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed.

These dates go back several years as seen in the (left) screenshot below, so Google Tasks has been storing this information from the beginning. This is a nice quality-of-life improvement for checking when you recently accomplished something, especially reminders without due dates. It’s a small step towards making Google Tasks less of a basic to-do app. As of today, completed dates are appearing in the standalone Google Tasks for Android and iOS (which has yet to be redesigned). It’s not currently available for the integrated Google Calendar experience on the web and Android. Meanwhile, Google is testing a count of uncompleted tasks next to list names in the top tab switcher. This vertical pill-shaped container appears on everything but your current list. We’re only seeing this on one device, and it’s a bit distracting. Given the prominence, it feels more like a notice for tasks that have missed their due date. The option to disable this would be nice, with the app today only offering settings for Notifications and Theme. Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed.

These dates go back several years as seen in the (left) screenshot below, so Google Tasks has been storing this information from the beginning. This is a nice quality-of-life improvement for checking when you recently accomplished something, especially reminders without due dates. It’s a small step towards making Google Tasks less of a basic to-do app. As of today, completed dates are appearing in the standalone Google Tasks for Android and iOS (which has yet to be redesigned). It’s not currently available for the integrated Google Calendar experience on the web and Android. Meanwhile, Google is testing a count of uncompleted tasks next to list names in the top tab switcher. This vertical pill-shaped container appears on everything but your current list. We’re only seeing this on one device, and it’s a bit distracting. Given the prominence, it feels more like a notice for tasks that have missed their due date. The option to disable this would be nice, with the app today only offering settings for Notifications and Theme. Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed.

These dates go back several years as seen in the (left) screenshot below, so Google Tasks has been storing this information from the beginning. This is a nice quality-of-life improvement for checking when you recently accomplished something, especially reminders without due dates. It’s a small step towards making Google Tasks less of a basic to-do app. As of today, completed dates are appearing in the standalone Google Tasks for Android and iOS (which has yet to be redesigned). It’s not currently available for the integrated Google Calendar experience on the web and Android. Meanwhile, Google is testing a count of uncompleted tasks next to list names in the top tab switcher. This vertical pill-shaped container appears on everything but your current list. We’re only seeing this on one device, and it’s a bit distracting. Given the prominence, it feels more like a notice for tasks that have missed their due date. The option to disable this would be nice, with the app today only offering settings for Notifications and Theme. Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed.

In a short support post today, the company announced how “Google Photos is expanding the group of eligible devices where you can display albums in a slideshow on the ambient or idle screen of your device. ” The new supported form factors are: Smart TVs, Tablets, Fridges, and Photo frames. The existing list includes: Google TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Pixel Tablet, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max. These devices offer a Google-built slideshow experience that can be controlled via the Google Photos app (Settings \u003e Apps \u0026 devices \u003e Photo frames). It can also be set via the Google Home app. It now seems like something similar will be coming to third-party devices. Some smart fridges already offer Google Photos integration, while bringing Google Photos to non-Android/Google TV sets is a good idea and dedicated photo frame devices are always popular. Google today is not announcing any of the new devices or integrations.

In a short support post today, the company announced how “Google Photos is expanding the group of eligible devices where you can display albums in a slideshow on the ambient or idle screen of your device. ” The new supported form factors are: Smart TVs, Tablets, Fridges, and Photo frames. The existing list includes: Google TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Pixel Tablet, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max. These devices offer a Google-built slideshow experience that can be controlled via the Google Photos app (Settings \u003e Apps \u0026 devices \u003e Photo frames). It can also be set via the Google Home app. It now seems like something similar will be coming to third-party devices. Some smart fridges already offer Google Photos integration, while bringing Google Photos to non-Android/Google TV sets is a good idea and dedicated photo frame devices are always popular. Google today is not announcing any of the new devices or integrations.

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support — from launch — of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer’s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won’t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it’s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup — from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee – that includes returns during that period – customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a “used” smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms – so it isn’t necessarily “better” in every instance. If you’re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon’s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google’s own “Certified Refurbished Pixel Phones” program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 – giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It’s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support — from launch — of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer’s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won’t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it’s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup — from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee – that includes returns during that period – customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a “used” smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms – so it isn’t necessarily “better” in every instance. If you’re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon’s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google’s own “Certified Refurbished Pixel Phones” program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 – giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It’s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.

With that in mind, here are some of the best deals on Google Pixel phones from the online retailer. Table of contentsWhy buy a renewed or refurbished phone?Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe?The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on AmazonThe best deals on new Google Pixel devices Why buy a renewed or refurbished phone? There are several reasons to get a renewed or refurbished phone over a brand-new handset, including discounts and cost savings. The days of limited support windows on Android are behind us. Google offers 5 years of software support — from launch — of the Pixel 6 and 7 series. This extends to 7 full years with the Pixel 8 and 9 series. Pixel Buyer’s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won’t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it’s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup — from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee – that includes returns during that period – customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a “used” smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms – so it isn’t necessarily “better” in every instance. If you’re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon’s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google’s own “Certified Refurbished Pixel Phones” program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 – giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It’s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.

Pixel Buyer’s Guide: Which is the right Google phone for you? [Video] The great news is that if you buy an older device, you won’t miss out on Android security updates and OS releases. For that reason, it’s easier than ever to recommend an older Pixel phone. Online stores like Amazon offer much greater discounts than the current generation, but there are often sales discounts, deals, and rebates across the entire Google Pixel lineup — from earbuds to accessories. Is buying a renewed Google Pixel from Amazon safe? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, yes. Advertisement - scroll for more content Amazon Renewed effectively offers discounted, like-new products that have been professionally inspected and tested. These certified refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items undergo rigorous checks to ensure they work and look like new. Backed by a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee – that includes returns during that period – customers can save money on a variety of products while this program supposedly contributes to a more sustainable environment by reducing electronic waste. The idea is that this is slightly better than a “used” smartphone or product that might have some undiagnosed issues or problems that are not visible or apparent when buying from other sites like Swappa or eBay. However, you might get better deals on Google Pixel phones using those platforms – so it isn’t necessarily “better” in every instance. If you’re buying a smartphone, being able to return it if you have issues is a valuable bonus. This applies even if the refurbished product is being sold through a third-party store or seller using Amazon’s platform. If you have a problem, regular customer service procedures will apply to allow you to get the support you need. The current best deals on renewed Google Pixel devices on Amazon Amazon is more aggressive in offering deals for used Google Pixel phones. Google’s own “Certified Refurbished Pixel Phones” program cannot compete with the pricing. This program does not offer devices above the 7 series as of January 2025 – giving you fewer options. You are probably aware that Swappa is another good place to buy used devices. However, this is a marketplace for individuals to sell their used tech and other products. It’s a great platform, but you may have a very inconsistent experience with it, and pricing can vary wildly depending on the seller.

Career Dreamer uses AI to analyze your past experiences and suggest potential new gigs. “Think of it like a helping hand to bridge where you’ve been and imagine where you could go next,” Google says. The tool begins with some basic questions about previous experiences, skills, and interests. Career Dreamer will then generate a \"career identity statement,\" which can be added to a resume or used as talking points during interviews. If you like the draft, click “Explore paths” and move to the next stage. Otherwise, you can click the “Re-generate” button to generate another draft. On the next page, the tool will use Gemini and job market data from Lightcast and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to suggest domains where your skills can be applied. Hovering over each career option will give details about the field and why you might fit in. “It can even help you discover training resources like Google Career Certificates and Google Cloud Skills Boost,” Google says. Additionally, click the “Explore paths based on” button in the center to filter out options based on your experiences, education, skills, or interests. The last stage involves using the Gemini chatbot. You can ask the chatbot to draft a cover letter, improve your resume, or provide new career exploration ideas. However, as TechCrunch notes, Career Dreamer won’t connect you to actual job postings like LinkedIn or Indeed. In Google’s own words, it’s a tool that would assist someone “just wondering what’s out there. \" More Inside PCMag. com Can AI Make You Happier at Work?

It’s no longer a floating panel arranged in a 3×3 grid. The new menu features a Material 3 layout with large buttons. Old vs. new Meanwhile, instead of placing the reaction picker at the top of the overflow menu, there’s now an emoji button in the floating control bar. This opens the same row of emoji, which is now closer to the bottom of your screen. Advertisement - scroll for more content The emoji button replaces the hand raise feature, which is now in the overflow menu as a giant button at the top. This change just applies to mobile devices, with the button still front and center on tablets. Host (management) controls and “Report a problem” have been removed from the overflow menu into the fullscreen settings page, which can be accessed from the bottom-left corner of the new sheet. The final change for Google Meet on iOS moves the end call button from “left side to the right side of the primary controls” to match all other platforms. This redesign of Google Meet controls is rolling out first to Android in the coming weeks for all users, with iOS following later.

This is no longer the case, with a manual “Read my notifications” command now required. Additionally: “Assistant will also no longer read unread notifications automatically and allow you to reply. ” Google does not provide a real reason for this removal in announcing this change yesterday (via Android Authority): Advertisement - scroll for more content Thank you for your continued feedback that enables us to improve your experience with using Google Assistant! This breaks the silent use case for owners of Google Assistant headphones, while it’s not apparent when new notifications come in. Google has yet to expand Gemini beyond the Pixel Buds Pro. Notably, spoken notifications are only available for messaging apps with the new smart assistant. The promise of Gemini is that it will one day summarize alerts for a more streamlined experience. Google alluded to that at launch, but we’re still waiting.

This is no longer the case, with a manual “Read my notifications” command now required. Additionally: “Assistant will also no longer read unread notifications automatically and allow you to reply. ” Google does not provide a real reason for this removal in announcing this change yesterday (via Android Authority): Advertisement - scroll for more content Thank you for your continued feedback that enables us to improve your experience with using Google Assistant! This breaks the silent use case for owners of Google Assistant headphones, while it’s not apparent when new notifications come in. Google has yet to expand Gemini beyond the Pixel Buds Pro. Notably, spoken notifications are only available for messaging apps with the new smart assistant. The promise of Gemini is that it will one day summarize alerts for a more streamlined experience. Google alluded to that at launch, but we’re still waiting.

This is no longer the case, with a manual “Read my notifications” command now required. Additionally: “Assistant will also no longer read unread notifications automatically and allow you to reply. ” Google does not provide a real reason for this removal in announcing this change yesterday (via Android Authority): Advertisement - scroll for more content Thank you for your continued feedback that enables us to improve your experience with using Google Assistant! This breaks the silent use case for owners of Google Assistant headphones, while it’s not apparent when new notifications come in. Google has yet to expand Gemini beyond the Pixel Buds Pro. Notably, spoken notifications are only available for messaging apps with the new smart assistant. The promise of Gemini is that it will one day summarize alerts for a more streamlined experience. Google alluded to that at launch, but we’re still waiting.

As of Thursday afternoon in the US Google Store, “No longer available” appears in the product listing for the Chromecast with Google TV. The Smart Home \u003e Streaming landing page only lists the Google TV Streamer. Both the 2020 4K and 2022 HD models were still listed in some colors earlier this week. At $49. 99 and $29. 99, they were significantly cheaper than their intended replacement. With the unveil of the Streamer in August, the company said the Chromecast would remain on sale until inventory runs out. There are no changes to product support and updates. We’re still waiting for the Android 14 update. Advertisement - scroll for more content Officially, Google believes that people no longer want cheap streaming devices as even the most affordable televisions offer that basic functionality. The new streaming box marked an end to the brand. You might still find them at third-party retailers, but inventory there is also running low. Best Buy currently lists the HD model for $14. 99 in a clearance sale, but it’s no longer available offline. Meanwhile, the Voice Remote for Chromecast with Google TV is currently not on sale, though there’s a “Get notified” option. You can buy the Google TV Streamer Voice Remote instead, but “Find My Remote and creating a shortcut with the customizable button only work with Google TV Streamer. ” More on Chromecast: First Chromecast with Google TV update of 2025 rolling out This case lets you easily mount or hang Google TV Streamer on the back of your TV Chromecast remote got the volume buttons right; Google TV Streamer is a downgrade Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed.

It’s a relatively new feature that was first announced last year, which has the ability to explore complex topics and conduct intensive research about them, answering very specific questions the user might have. After scouring the internet and analyzing hundreds or even thousands of sources, it’ll present its findings in a comprehensive, yet easy to read report, the company explains. The main advantage of Deep Research is that it can do in a matter of minutes what would take a human researcher multiple hours to do, and it can be useful in a range of different business and educational scenarios. For instance, Google says it’s ideal for industry research, helping businesses to better understand emerging trends they need to be aware of, such as sustainable battery technologies to help inform a company’s clean technology strategies. Another promising use case is competitive research. An organization could use it to perform a deep analysis of their local and global competitors, or find the ideal location for setting up a new small business, Google said. Alternatively, it can be used for customer research. So a salesperson for example could use it to create a comprehensive report on his or her company’s products and services, tailored for a specific client. In addition, educators can use Deep Research for tasks such as lesson planning, class project development, presentations and grant writing, creating reports on almost any topic, Google said. At this time, Deep Research is being made exclusively available to paid Google Workspace users with access to Gemini Advanced. Google Workspace is the company’s productivity suite, containing tools like Google Docs and Sheets. Gemini Advanced is the premium version of the Gemini AI application, offering support for vastly more tokens than the regular app and additional perks like more storage space. To get started with Deep Research in Google Workspace, Gemini Advanced users have to switch to the “1. 5 Pro with Deep Research” model in the app, and then all they have to do is enter a simple prompt regarding the topic they wish to research in depth. Deep Research will then create a multi-step research plan that users can revise as needed, and once it’s ready to go, it will immediately start analyzing the most relevant information it finds from its web search. As it works, it will refine its analysis based on what it learns. So, for example, if it’s researching a new trend about clean batteries and discovers a promising new technology in that area, it will automatically dig up as much info as it can about that new tech. Once the research is done, Deep Research will generate a comprehensive report that summarizes the key findings of what it has learned. According to Google, it’s presented in an easy-to-digest format with relevant links to all of the important, original sources, so users can conduct a deeper dive into different aspects if they need. In addition, users will be able to ask follow up questions and conduct even deeper research, if they desire. Google says Deep Research should be a great time saver, because conducting thorough research is a notoriously time consuming and monotonous task, and it’s not something that everyone can do either, as it requires a certain degree of skill in terms of knowing what to search the web for. According to Google, it can condense hours of research into a matter of minutes on just about any topic. Deep Research is available now for Google Workspace users on the web, with mobile support coming later. At present, it’s only supported in English, but the company says it will extend it to additional languages soon. Alongside Deep Research, Google also announced a couple of new experimental models in Gemini Advanced, including 2. 0 Flash Thinking Experimental and 2. 0 Pro Experimental, which are currently ranked as the world’s second and third most powerful generative AI models respectively on Imarena’s Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard. The 2. 0 Flash Thinking Experimental model is Google’s most advanced “reasoning model” thus far, and differs from traditional generative AI models in that it breaks down prompts into a series of steps to improve its reasoning abilities and deliver better responses. Uniquely, it breaks down its entire thought process, so users can trace its line of reasoning and understand the assumptions it made.

It’s a relatively new feature that was first announced last year, which has the ability to explore complex topics and conduct intensive research about them, answering very specific questions the user might have. After scouring the internet and analyzing hundreds or even thousands of sources, it’ll present its findings in a comprehensive, yet easy to read report, the company explains. The main advantage of Deep Research is that it can do in a matter of minutes what would take a human researcher multiple hours to do, and it can be useful in a range of different business and educational scenarios. For instance, Google says it’s ideal for industry research, helping businesses to better understand emerging trends they need to be aware of, such as sustainable battery technologies to help inform a company’s clean technology strategies. Another promising use case is competitive research. An organization could use it to perform a deep analysis of their local and global competitors, or find the ideal location for setting up a new small business, Google said. Alternatively, it can be used for customer research. So a salesperson for example could use it to create a comprehensive report on his or her company’s products and services, tailored for a specific client. In addition, educators can use Deep Research for tasks such as lesson planning, class project development, presentations and grant writing, creating reports on almost any topic, Google said. At this time, Deep Research is being made exclusively available to paid Google Workspace users with access to Gemini Advanced. Google Workspace is the company’s productivity suite, containing tools like Google Docs and Sheets. Gemini Advanced is the premium version of the Gemini AI application, offering support for vastly more tokens than the regular app and additional perks like more storage space. To get started with Deep Research in Google Workspace, Gemini Advanced users have to switch to the “1. 5 Pro with Deep Research” model in the app, and then all they have to do is enter a simple prompt regarding the topic they wish to research in depth. Deep Research will then create a multi-step research plan that users can revise as needed, and once it’s ready to go, it will immediately start analyzing the most relevant information it finds from its web search. As it works, it will refine its analysis based on what it learns. So, for example, if it’s researching a new trend about clean batteries and discovers a promising new technology in that area, it will automatically dig up as much info as it can about that new tech. Once the research is done, Deep Research will generate a comprehensive report that summarizes the key findings of what it has learned. According to Google, it’s presented in an easy-to-digest format with relevant links to all of the important, original sources, so users can conduct a deeper dive into different aspects if they need. In addition, users will be able to ask follow up questions and conduct even deeper research, if they desire. Google says Deep Research should be a great time saver, because conducting thorough research is a notoriously time consuming and monotonous task, and it’s not something that everyone can do either, as it requires a certain degree of skill in terms of knowing what to search the web for. According to Google, it can condense hours of research into a matter of minutes on just about any topic. Deep Research is available now for Google Workspace users on the web, with mobile support coming later. At present, it’s only supported in English, but the company says it will extend it to additional languages soon. Alongside Deep Research, Google also announced a couple of new experimental models in Gemini Advanced, including 2. 0 Flash Thinking Experimental and 2. 0 Pro Experimental, which are currently ranked as the world’s second and third most powerful generative AI models respectively on Imarena’s Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard. The 2. 0 Flash Thinking Experimental model is Google’s most advanced “reasoning model” thus far, and differs from traditional generative AI models in that it breaks down prompts into a series of steps to improve its reasoning abilities and deliver better responses. Uniquely, it breaks down its entire thought process, so users can trace its line of reasoning and understand the assumptions it made.

So a salesperson for example could use it to create a comprehensive report on his or her company’s products and services, tailored for a specific client. In addition, educators can use Deep Research for tasks such as lesson planning, class project development, presentations and grant writing, creating reports on almost any topic, Google said. At this time, Deep Research is being made exclusively available to paid Google Workspace users with access to Gemini Advanced. Google Workspace is the company’s productivity suite, containing tools like Google Docs and Sheets. Gemini Advanced is the premium version of the Gemini AI application, offering support for vastly more tokens than the regular app and additional perks like more storage space. To get started with Deep Research in Google Workspace, Gemini Advanced users have to switch to the “1. 5 Pro with Deep Research” model in the app, and then all they have to do is enter a simple prompt regarding the topic they wish to research in depth. Deep Research will then create a multi-step research plan that users can revise as needed, and once it’s ready to go, it will immediately start analyzing the most relevant information it finds from its web search. As it works, it will refine its analysis based on what it learns. So, for example, if it’s researching a new trend about clean batteries and discovers a promising new technology in that area, it will automatically dig up as much info as it can about that new tech. Once the research is done, Deep Research will generate a comprehensive report that summarizes the key findings of what it has learned. According to Google, it’s presented in an easy-to-digest format with relevant links to all of the important, original sources, so users can conduct a deeper dive into different aspects if they need. In addition, users will be able to ask follow up questions and conduct even deeper research, if they desire. Google says Deep Research should be a great time saver, because conducting thorough research is a notoriously time consuming and monotonous task, and it’s not something that everyone can do either, as it requires a certain degree of skill in terms of knowing what to search the web for. According to Google, it can condense hours of research into a matter of minutes on just about any topic. Deep Research is available now for Google Workspace users on the web, with mobile support coming later. At present, it’s only supported in English, but the company says it will extend it to additional languages soon. Alongside Deep Research, Google also announced a couple of new experimental models in Gemini Advanced, including 2. 0 Flash Thinking Experimental and 2. 0 Pro Experimental, which are currently ranked as the world’s second and third most powerful generative AI models respectively on Imarena’s Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard. The 2. 0 Flash Thinking Experimental model is Google’s most advanced “reasoning model” thus far, and differs from traditional generative AI models in that it breaks down prompts into a series of steps to improve its reasoning abilities and deliver better responses. Uniquely, it breaks down its entire thought process, so users can trace its line of reasoning and understand the assumptions it made.

Google Cloud’s Multi-Factor Authentication Mandate: Setting a Standard or Creating an Illusion of Security? by Mark Rasch on February 21, 2025 Google Cloud recently announced that it will require all users to adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA) by the end of 2025, joining other major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure in mandating this critical security measure. As the threat landscape intensifies, with phishing and credential theft becoming common attack vectors, Google’s phased rollout of mandatory MFA marks a major step in the evolution of cloud security. Starting in November 2024, administrators will begin receiving guidance on implementing MFA, leading up to mandatory MFA for all new and existing users in early 2025, and eventually expanding to federated accounts by the end of the year. As one of the largest cloud providers in the world, Google Cloud holds a significant market share, trailing only AWS and Microsoft Azure. This influence makes its security decisions impactful, not only for Google’s users but for the broader cloud computing industry. The MFA mandate sets a high standard that will likely shape industry expectations around security practices. However, as widely adopted as MFA has become, it is far from infallible. MFA’s effectiveness often depends on the specific “factors” employed and the channels through which they are verified, raising questions about whether Google’s mandate genuinely improves security or merely offers an illusion of it. This article explores Google Cloud’s MFA initiative, its practical limitations and the potential for it to set a legal standard of care in cybersecurity. The Scope of Google’s MFA Mandate Google Cloud’s approach to MFA will unfold in three stages. Initially, administrators will be informed about the upgrade and offered support resources for a smooth transition. Next, in early 2025, all new and existing users will be required to use MFA, signaling Google’s firm commitment to strengthening access control. Finally, by the end of 2025, MFA will be extended to cover federated accounts, which are often tied to organizations’ single sign-on (SSO) solutions. This phased deployment aligns with Google’s emphasis on ensuring security without disrupting user access. The company’s decision to implement MFA for its vast user base reflects a response to growing cybersecurity threats, particularly as attackers increasingly rely on credential theft to infiltrate systems. Google’s market position as a leading cloud provider amplifies the significance of this mandate, potentially influencing cybersecurity practices across sectors reliant on cloud infrastructure. Google’s Market Influence and the Push for MFA Google Cloud’s influence on cloud computing extends across multiple industries, from small businesses to large enterprises and government entities. With its substantial market share, Google’s decisions set a precedent for other providers and affect countless businesses using cloud services for data storage, application hosting and virtual infrastructure. AWS and Microsoft Azure have already implemented similar MFA requirements, making Google Cloud’s announcement part of a larger trend among leading cloud providers. This convergence around MFA among the top three providers underscores the shift toward MFA as a foundational security measure. However, while Google’s decision could drive broader adoption of MFA across industries, it also prompts questions about MFA’s effectiveness in thwarting sophisticated cyberthreats. The Illusion of Security: MFA’s Vulnerabilities and Limitations Although MFA is widely regarded as an essential security measure, it is not a panacea. MFA’s actual effectiveness depends heavily on the type and implementation of the factors involved. In many cases, MFA offers only the illusion of enhanced security, as attackers have developed techniques to circumvent it. One of the most common MFA methods involves sending a one-time passcode (OTP) to the user’s mobile device, usually via SMS. This approach, known as “out-of-band” authentication, adds a second layer of verification. However, SMS-based MFA is vulnerable to SIM swapping, a method in which attackers hijack a victim’s phone number by convincing the victim’s mobile carrier to transfer the number to a new SIM card under the attacker’s control. Once the attacker has control over the victim’s phone number, they can intercept OTPs sent via SMS, effectively bypassing the MFA layer. The surge in SIM swapping attacks highlights the weaknesses in relying on phone-based verification. Without more secure alternatives, such as hardware tokens or app-based authentication, SMS-based MFA can be exploited to compromise accounts. Google has addressed this vulnerability to some extent by offering app-based authentication options, such as Google Authenticator, but many users still rely on SMS, either due to convenience or lack of awareness of alternatives. Attackers can also exploit MFA through phishing and “MFA fatigue” techniques. In phishing attacks, attackers may lure victims into providing both their passwords and OTPs by posing as legitimate entities. Some attackers send repeated MFA prompts to a user’s device until the user eventually approves a fraudulent request out of annoyance or confusion, a tactic known as MFA fatigue. These tactics reveal that even sophisticated MFA systems are not foolproof, as they rely on user behavior as much as technological barriers. MFA vs. Multi-Factor Multi-Channel Authentication An important distinction to make is that MFA is not the same as multi-factor multi-channel authentication (MFMCA).",

Google Cloud’s Multi-Factor Authentication Mandate: Setting a Standard or Creating an Illusion of Security? by Mark Rasch on February 21, 2025 Google Cloud recently announced that it will require all users to adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA) by the end of 2025, joining other major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure in mandating this critical security measure. As the threat landscape intensifies, with phishing and credential theft becoming common attack vectors, Google’s phased rollout of mandatory MFA marks a major step in the evolution of cloud security. Starting in November 2024, administrators will begin receiving guidance on implementing MFA, leading up to mandatory MFA for all new and existing users in early 2025, and eventually expanding to federated accounts by the end of the year. As one of the largest cloud providers in the world, Google Cloud holds a significant market share, trailing only AWS and Microsoft Azure. This influence makes its security decisions impactful, not only for Google’s users but for the broader cloud computing industry. The MFA mandate sets a high standard that will likely shape industry expectations around security practices. However, as widely adopted as MFA has become, it is far from infallible. MFA’s effectiveness often depends on the specific “factors” employed and the channels through which they are verified, raising questions about whether Google’s mandate genuinely improves security or merely offers an illusion of it. This article explores Google Cloud’s MFA initiative, its practical limitations and the potential for it to set a legal standard of care in cybersecurity. The Scope of Google’s MFA Mandate Google Cloud’s approach to MFA will unfold in three stages. Initially, administrators will be informed about the upgrade and offered support resources for a smooth transition. Next, in early 2025, all new and existing users will be required to use MFA, signaling Google’s firm commitment to strengthening access control. Finally, by the end of 2025, MFA will be extended to cover federated accounts, which are often tied to organizations’ single sign-on (SSO) solutions. This phased deployment aligns with Google’s emphasis on ensuring security without disrupting user access. The company’s decision to implement MFA for its vast user base reflects a response to growing cybersecurity threats, particularly as attackers increasingly rely on credential theft to infiltrate systems. Google’s market position as a leading cloud provider amplifies the significance of this mandate, potentially influencing cybersecurity practices across sectors reliant on cloud infrastructure. Google’s Market Influence and the Push for MFA Google Cloud’s influence on cloud computing extends across multiple industries, from small businesses to large enterprises and government entities. With its substantial market share, Google’s decisions set a precedent for other providers and affect countless businesses using cloud services for data storage, application hosting and virtual infrastructure. AWS and Microsoft Azure have already implemented similar MFA requirements, making Google Cloud’s announcement part of a larger trend among leading cloud providers. This convergence around MFA among the top three providers underscores the shift toward MFA as a foundational security measure. However, while Google’s decision could drive broader adoption of MFA across industries, it also prompts questions about MFA’s effectiveness in thwarting sophisticated cyberthreats. The Illusion of Security: MFA’s Vulnerabilities and Limitations Although MFA is widely regarded as an essential security measure, it is not a panacea. MFA’s actual effectiveness depends heavily on the type and implementation of the factors involved. In many cases, MFA offers only the illusion of enhanced security, as attackers have developed techniques to circumvent it. One of the most common MFA methods involves sending a one-time passcode (OTP) to the user’s mobile device, usually via SMS. This approach, known as “out-of-band” authentication, adds a second layer of verification. However, SMS-based MFA is vulnerable to SIM swapping, a method in which attackers hijack a victim’s phone number by convincing the victim’s mobile carrier to transfer the number to a new SIM card under the attacker’s control. Once the attacker has control over the victim’s phone number, they can intercept OTPs sent via SMS, effectively bypassing the MFA layer. The surge in SIM swapping attacks highlights the weaknesses in relying on phone-based verification. Without more secure alternatives, such as hardware tokens or app-based authentication, SMS-based MFA can be exploited to compromise accounts. Google has addressed this vulnerability to some extent by offering app-based authentication options, such as Google Authenticator, but many users still rely on SMS, either due to convenience or lack of awareness of alternatives. Attackers can also exploit MFA through phishing and “MFA fatigue” techniques. In phishing attacks, attackers may lure victims into providing both their passwords and OTPs by posing as legitimate entities. Some attackers send repeated MFA prompts to a user’s device until the user eventually approves a fraudulent request out of annoyance or confusion, a tactic known as MFA fatigue. These tactics reveal that even sophisticated MFA systems are not foolproof, as they rely on user behavior as much as technological barriers. MFA vs. Multi-Factor Multi-Channel Authentication An important distinction to make is that MFA is not the same as multi-factor multi-channel authentication (MFMCA).",
