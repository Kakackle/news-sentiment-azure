TRENDING: iOS 18 iPhone 16 Apple Watch Battery Life M4 MacBook Pro AirPods Max 2 watchOS 11 Apple One Reset AirPods iPad sideloading Home Tech Apps \u0026 Software Gemini AI is no longer available in the iOS Google app for an obvious reason By José Adorno Published Feb 19th, 2025 8:59AM EST Image: Google If you buy through a BGR link, we may earn an affiliate commission, helping support our expert product labs. Google Gemini features will no longer be available in the iOS Google app. As AndroidCentral spotted, the company emailed Gemini users to highlight this change. “We’re making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS,” the email said. “Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini. To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store. ”This change occurred because Google wants to prioritize the Google Gemini app for iOS instead of needing to maintain Gemini features in multiple apps. Since the company released a proper Gemini app late last year, it’s only natural that the company is focusing on it. In the aforementioned email, Google highlights all the main features users can take advantage of in the Gemini app, including: Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Go Live with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, simplify complex topics and rehearse for important moments; Gemini connects with your favorite Google apps like Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more; Study smarter and explore any topic with interactive visuals and real-word examples; Unlock a world of expertise and get tailored information about any topic; Plan trips better and faster; Create AI-generated images in seconds; Get summaries, deep dives, and source links all in one place; Brainstorm new ideas or improve existing ones. If you try to use Google Gemini features under the Google app, there’s a new screen that shows “Gemini has its own app. Download the Gemini app for iPhone. ” That said, it’s likely that the company will soon remove references to its AI from its main app in the near future. Even though Gemini isn’t fully integrated with Apple Intelligence, as ChatGPT is, iPhone 15 Pro users or newer can integrate the Gemini experience with the Action Button and other shortcuts.

TRENDING: iOS 18 iPhone 16 Apple Watch Battery Life M4 MacBook Pro AirPods Max 2 watchOS 11 Apple One Reset AirPods iPad sideloading Home Tech Apps \u0026 Software Gemini AI is no longer available in the iOS Google app for an obvious reason By José Adorno Published Feb 19th, 2025 8:59AM EST Image: Google If you buy through a BGR link, we may earn an affiliate commission, helping support our expert product labs. Google Gemini features will no longer be available in the iOS Google app. As AndroidCentral spotted, the company emailed Gemini users to highlight this change. “We’re making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS,” the email said. “Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini. To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store. ”This change occurred because Google wants to prioritize the Google Gemini app for iOS instead of needing to maintain Gemini features in multiple apps. Since the company released a proper Gemini app late last year, it’s only natural that the company is focusing on it. In the aforementioned email, Google highlights all the main features users can take advantage of in the Gemini app, including: Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Go Live with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, simplify complex topics and rehearse for important moments; Gemini connects with your favorite Google apps like Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more; Study smarter and explore any topic with interactive visuals and real-word examples; Unlock a world of expertise and get tailored information about any topic; Plan trips better and faster; Create AI-generated images in seconds; Get summaries, deep dives, and source links all in one place; Brainstorm new ideas or improve existing ones. If you try to use Google Gemini features under the Google app, there’s a new screen that shows “Gemini has its own app. Download the Gemini app for iPhone. ” That said, it’s likely that the company will soon remove references to its AI from its main app in the near future. Even though Gemini isn’t fully integrated with Apple Intelligence, as ChatGPT is, iPhone 15 Pro users or newer can integrate the Gemini experience with the Action Button and other shortcuts.

Italian prosecutors said Wednesday they will seek to drop a tax evasion investigation against Google after the tech giant agreed to pay a 326 million euro ($340 million) settlement. Milan prosecutors had opened an investigation against Google for failure to pay taxes on earnings in Italy from 2015-2019. The investigation focused on revenues from the sale of advertising, and cited the presence of servers and other infrastructure in Italy. Google acknowledged the settlement in statement, saying it resolves “a tax audit . . . without litigation. ” Tech giant Google previously paid over $1 billion to French authorities to settle a yearslong dispute over allegations of tax fraud.

Digital mapping experts say fatal incidents reveal systemic challenges to mapping Indian roads. Ananya Bhattacharya, Rest of World 35 minutes ago Read in App Augusto Zambonato for Rest of World This article was originally published in Rest of World, which covers technology’s impact outside the West. Earlier in February, an Indian politician urged the country’s Parliament to support homegrown alternatives to Google Maps – blaming the popular navigation app for fatal accidents. “Incidents due to Google Maps errors in India are becoming a more and more serious issue,” Ajeet Madhavrao Gopchade said. “These incidents highlight that directions on Google Maps are not always correct. ”Gopchade mentioned two accidents: one from November 2024, in which three men died in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh after their car veered off an under-construction bridge, and another from October 2023, when two doctors from Kerala lost their lives by following the navigation app to a river they mistook for a waterlogged street. These are among a series of reported misdirections involving Google Maps in India. In 2024, three people had to be rescued from a canal in Uttar Pradesh after they followed driving directions on the app. A car in Tamil Nadu landed at a flight of stairs when its driver opted for the “fastest route” on Google Maps, and a family traveling from Bihar to Goa wound up stranded in a forest in Karnataka. Google Maps is the most-used navigation app by consumers in India, with millions of daily users and an average of 50 million searches in multiple languages each day. The country is also home to Google Maps’ largest network of contributors – around 60 million people who add content such as reviews, photos, and road updates. Yet, the inconsistent quality of its data has brought the app under scrutiny. Digital mapping experts, however, believe these incidents are not specific to Google Maps and instead reveal systemic challenges to mapping Indian roads. Maintaining precision is daunting for any navigation app in India since road names and addresses are not standardised, according to Muskan Thareja, a geospatial technology expert who previously worked at geoanalytics company GeoSpoc, which was acquired by Ola in 2021. “Some houses have a house number, but [a] majority of the houses do not,” Thareja told Rest of World. “Google already has some coding around it but it’s not really very applicable in India, so that is where the majority of the problem lies. ”Lalitha Ramani, general manager for Google Maps India, told Rest of World the company has been undertaking several initiatives within the country to “make navigation and exploration journeys more efficient and sustainable”. When Google Maps launched in India in 2008, it initially struggled due to the lack of street names, which were the foundation of its technology globally. In an X post from October 2023, Elizabeth Laraki, who led the global design team for Google Maps from 2007 to 2009, wrote that this rendered the app’s directions “pretty much useless. ” The company subsequently used parks, monuments, shopping centers, landmark buildings, and gas stations to confirm directions instead. Over the years, Google has launched several new features to improve Maps in India, including voice navigation and transliterated directions in about nine and 10 languages, respectively, to increase accessibility. Most recently, in 2024, the company introduced a simplified interface for reporting road incidents, two new weather-related alerts for streets obscured by flooding or fog, an artificial-intelligence model that estimates road widths, and a feature that alerts users to approaching overpasses in 40 cities. Google has mapped 300 million buildings, 35 million businesses and places, and streets stretching across 7 million kilometres in India, Ramani told Rest of World. India has been “an innovation hub for Google Maps,” since many features saw “their genesis in the country”, Ramani said. She cited examples such as landmark-based navigation, offline maps, and two-wheeler mode, which debuted in India. “[We] rely on our AI tech, data from local agencies and government partners, Street View, and satellite images, in addition to our active community of contributors, enabling millions of updates a day,” Ramani added. “There remains work to do, and it’s something we’re always working to improve. ” She did not respond to queries on specific incidents related to misdirection reported in recent years. The navigation problems are not specific to India.",

Digital mapping experts say fatal incidents reveal systemic challenges to mapping Indian roads. Ananya Bhattacharya, Rest of World 35 minutes ago Read in App Augusto Zambonato for Rest of World This article was originally published in Rest of World, which covers technology’s impact outside the West. Earlier in February, an Indian politician urged the country’s Parliament to support homegrown alternatives to Google Maps – blaming the popular navigation app for fatal accidents. “Incidents due to Google Maps errors in India are becoming a more and more serious issue,” Ajeet Madhavrao Gopchade said. “These incidents highlight that directions on Google Maps are not always correct. ”Gopchade mentioned two accidents: one from November 2024, in which three men died in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh after their car veered off an under-construction bridge, and another from October 2023, when two doctors from Kerala lost their lives by following the navigation app to a river they mistook for a waterlogged street. These are among a series of reported misdirections involving Google Maps in India. In 2024, three people had to be rescued from a canal in Uttar Pradesh after they followed driving directions on the app. A car in Tamil Nadu landed at a flight of stairs when its driver opted for the “fastest route” on Google Maps, and a family traveling from Bihar to Goa wound up stranded in a forest in Karnataka. Google Maps is the most-used navigation app by consumers in India, with millions of daily users and an average of 50 million searches in multiple languages each day. The country is also home to Google Maps’ largest network of contributors – around 60 million people who add content such as reviews, photos, and road updates. Yet, the inconsistent quality of its data has brought the app under scrutiny. Digital mapping experts, however, believe these incidents are not specific to Google Maps and instead reveal systemic challenges to mapping Indian roads. Maintaining precision is daunting for any navigation app in India since road names and addresses are not standardised, according to Muskan Thareja, a geospatial technology expert who previously worked at geoanalytics company GeoSpoc, which was acquired by Ola in 2021. “Some houses have a house number, but [a] majority of the houses do not,” Thareja told Rest of World. “Google already has some coding around it but it’s not really very applicable in India, so that is where the majority of the problem lies. ”Lalitha Ramani, general manager for Google Maps India, told Rest of World the company has been undertaking several initiatives within the country to “make navigation and exploration journeys more efficient and sustainable”. When Google Maps launched in India in 2008, it initially struggled due to the lack of street names, which were the foundation of its technology globally. In an X post from October 2023, Elizabeth Laraki, who led the global design team for Google Maps from 2007 to 2009, wrote that this rendered the app’s directions “pretty much useless. ” The company subsequently used parks, monuments, shopping centers, landmark buildings, and gas stations to confirm directions instead. Over the years, Google has launched several new features to improve Maps in India, including voice navigation and transliterated directions in about nine and 10 languages, respectively, to increase accessibility. Most recently, in 2024, the company introduced a simplified interface for reporting road incidents, two new weather-related alerts for streets obscured by flooding or fog, an artificial-intelligence model that estimates road widths, and a feature that alerts users to approaching overpasses in 40 cities. Google has mapped 300 million buildings, 35 million businesses and places, and streets stretching across 7 million kilometres in India, Ramani told Rest of World. India has been “an innovation hub for Google Maps,” since many features saw “their genesis in the country”, Ramani said. She cited examples such as landmark-based navigation, offline maps, and two-wheeler mode, which debuted in India. “[We] rely on our AI tech, data from local agencies and government partners, Street View, and satellite images, in addition to our active community of contributors, enabling millions of updates a day,” Ramani added. “There remains work to do, and it’s something we’re always working to improve. ” She did not respond to queries on specific incidents related to misdirection reported in recent years. The navigation problems are not specific to India.",

Digital mapping experts say fatal incidents reveal systemic challenges to mapping Indian roads. Ananya Bhattacharya, Rest of World 35 minutes ago Read in App Augusto Zambonato for Rest of World This article was originally published in Rest of World, which covers technology’s impact outside the West. Earlier in February, an Indian politician urged the country’s Parliament to support homegrown alternatives to Google Maps – blaming the popular navigation app for fatal accidents. “Incidents due to Google Maps errors in India are becoming a more and more serious issue,” Ajeet Madhavrao Gopchade said. “These incidents highlight that directions on Google Maps are not always correct. ”Gopchade mentioned two accidents: one from November 2024, in which three men died in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh after their car veered off an under-construction bridge, and another from October 2023, when two doctors from Kerala lost their lives by following the navigation app to a river they mistook for a waterlogged street. These are among a series of reported misdirections involving Google Maps in India. In 2024, three people had to be rescued from a canal in Uttar Pradesh after they followed driving directions on the app. A car in Tamil Nadu landed at a flight of stairs when its driver opted for the “fastest route” on Google Maps, and a family traveling from Bihar to Goa wound up stranded in a forest in Karnataka. Google Maps is the most-used navigation app by consumers in India, with millions of daily users and an average of 50 million searches in multiple languages each day. The country is also home to Google Maps’ largest network of contributors – around 60 million people who add content such as reviews, photos, and road updates. Yet, the inconsistent quality of its data has brought the app under scrutiny. Digital mapping experts, however, believe these incidents are not specific to Google Maps and instead reveal systemic challenges to mapping Indian roads. Maintaining precision is daunting for any navigation app in India since road names and addresses are not standardised, according to Muskan Thareja, a geospatial technology expert who previously worked at geoanalytics company GeoSpoc, which was acquired by Ola in 2021. “Some houses have a house number, but [a] majority of the houses do not,” Thareja told Rest of World. “Google already has some coding around it but it’s not really very applicable in India, so that is where the majority of the problem lies. ”Lalitha Ramani, general manager for Google Maps India, told Rest of World the company has been undertaking several initiatives within the country to “make navigation and exploration journeys more efficient and sustainable”. When Google Maps launched in India in 2008, it initially struggled due to the lack of street names, which were the foundation of its technology globally. In an X post from October 2023, Elizabeth Laraki, who led the global design team for Google Maps from 2007 to 2009, wrote that this rendered the app’s directions “pretty much useless. ” The company subsequently used parks, monuments, shopping centers, landmark buildings, and gas stations to confirm directions instead. Over the years, Google has launched several new features to improve Maps in India, including voice navigation and transliterated directions in about nine and 10 languages, respectively, to increase accessibility. Most recently, in 2024, the company introduced a simplified interface for reporting road incidents, two new weather-related alerts for streets obscured by flooding or fog, an artificial-intelligence model that estimates road widths, and a feature that alerts users to approaching overpasses in 40 cities. Google has mapped 300 million buildings, 35 million businesses and places, and streets stretching across 7 million kilometres in India, Ramani told Rest of World. India has been “an innovation hub for Google Maps,” since many features saw “their genesis in the country”, Ramani said. She cited examples such as landmark-based navigation, offline maps, and two-wheeler mode, which debuted in India. “[We] rely on our AI tech, data from local agencies and government partners, Street View, and satellite images, in addition to our active community of contributors, enabling millions of updates a day,” Ramani added. “There remains work to do, and it’s something we’re always working to improve. ” She did not respond to queries on specific incidents related to misdirection reported in recent years. The navigation problems are not specific to India.",

Digital mapping experts say fatal incidents reveal systemic challenges to mapping Indian roads. Ananya Bhattacharya, Rest of World 35 minutes ago Read in App Augusto Zambonato for Rest of World This article was originally published in Rest of World, which covers technology’s impact outside the West. Earlier in February, an Indian politician urged the country’s Parliament to support homegrown alternatives to Google Maps – blaming the popular navigation app for fatal accidents. “Incidents due to Google Maps errors in India are becoming a more and more serious issue,” Ajeet Madhavrao Gopchade said. “These incidents highlight that directions on Google Maps are not always correct. ”Gopchade mentioned two accidents: one from November 2024, in which three men died in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh after their car veered off an under-construction bridge, and another from October 2023, when two doctors from Kerala lost their lives by following the navigation app to a river they mistook for a waterlogged street. These are among a series of reported misdirections involving Google Maps in India. In 2024, three people had to be rescued from a canal in Uttar Pradesh after they followed driving directions on the app. A car in Tamil Nadu landed at a flight of stairs when its driver opted for the “fastest route” on Google Maps, and a family traveling from Bihar to Goa wound up stranded in a forest in Karnataka. Google Maps is the most-used navigation app by consumers in India, with millions of daily users and an average of 50 million searches in multiple languages each day. The country is also home to Google Maps’ largest network of contributors – around 60 million people who add content such as reviews, photos, and road updates. Yet, the inconsistent quality of its data has brought the app under scrutiny. Digital mapping experts, however, believe these incidents are not specific to Google Maps and instead reveal systemic challenges to mapping Indian roads. Maintaining precision is daunting for any navigation app in India since road names and addresses are not standardised, according to Muskan Thareja, a geospatial technology expert who previously worked at geoanalytics company GeoSpoc, which was acquired by Ola in 2021. “Some houses have a house number, but [a] majority of the houses do not,” Thareja told Rest of World. “Google already has some coding around it but it’s not really very applicable in India, so that is where the majority of the problem lies. ”Lalitha Ramani, general manager for Google Maps India, told Rest of World the company has been undertaking several initiatives within the country to “make navigation and exploration journeys more efficient and sustainable”. When Google Maps launched in India in 2008, it initially struggled due to the lack of street names, which were the foundation of its technology globally. In an X post from October 2023, Elizabeth Laraki, who led the global design team for Google Maps from 2007 to 2009, wrote that this rendered the app’s directions “pretty much useless. ” The company subsequently used parks, monuments, shopping centers, landmark buildings, and gas stations to confirm directions instead. Over the years, Google has launched several new features to improve Maps in India, including voice navigation and transliterated directions in about nine and 10 languages, respectively, to increase accessibility. Most recently, in 2024, the company introduced a simplified interface for reporting road incidents, two new weather-related alerts for streets obscured by flooding or fog, an artificial-intelligence model that estimates road widths, and a feature that alerts users to approaching overpasses in 40 cities. Google has mapped 300 million buildings, 35 million businesses and places, and streets stretching across 7 million kilometres in India, Ramani told Rest of World. India has been “an innovation hub for Google Maps,” since many features saw “their genesis in the country”, Ramani said. She cited examples such as landmark-based navigation, offline maps, and two-wheeler mode, which debuted in India. “[We] rely on our AI tech, data from local agencies and government partners, Street View, and satellite images, in addition to our active community of contributors, enabling millions of updates a day,” Ramani added. “There remains work to do, and it’s something we’re always working to improve. ” She did not respond to queries on specific incidents related to misdirection reported in recent years. The navigation problems are not specific to India.",

Written by Artie Beaty, Contributing Writer Feb. 19, 2025 at 8:52 a. m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro ZDNETFocusing on the most important information in your work call is about to get a little easier. Google is rolling out a pair of new features for Meet today -- one that will help you catch up on missed information and one that will help you plan for what to do after the meeting. Expanded caption history First up is a significant change to how live captions work. At present, Google says, captions display in real time but go away once they're \"no longer relevant to the current conversation. \" With this change, you'll be able to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of live captions. There's a \"Jump to the bottom\" button to go back to what's happening currently. This is especially useful if you're late to the meeting and want to catch up or want to reference specific details from earlier in the meeting. Also: How to use Gemini's Deep Research to browse the web faster and better AI-generated 'Next Steps' GoogleAlso new is a \"Next Steps\" feature, an expansion of the \"Take Notes for me\" feature that rolled out last fall.",

Written by Artie Beaty, Contributing Writer Feb. 19, 2025 at 8:52 a. m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro ZDNETFocusing on the most important information in your work call is about to get a little easier. Google is rolling out a pair of new features for Meet today -- one that will help you catch up on missed information and one that will help you plan for what to do after the meeting. Expanded caption history First up is a significant change to how live captions work. At present, Google says, captions display in real time but go away once they're \"no longer relevant to the current conversation. \" With this change, you'll be able to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of live captions. There's a \"Jump to the bottom\" button to go back to what's happening currently. This is especially useful if you're late to the meeting and want to catch up or want to reference specific details from earlier in the meeting.

When Google unveiled Circle to Search in early 2024, I said I wanted a similar feature on the iPhone. More than a year later, Circle to Search is available on plenty of Galaxy, Pixel, and other Android phones, where Google controls the underlying operating system. But Circle to Search can’t come to the iPhone in the same way that it works on Android. However, Google on Wednesday launched the next best thing for iPhones. It’s called “Search Screen with Google Lens” instead of Circle to Search, but it works in a similar way. The feature is available inside the Google and Chrome apps on the iPhone, but it also supports gestures that are similar to Circle to Search. Unfortunately, invoking the iPhone version of Circle to Search isn’t as simple as using it on Android devices. Before drawing, highlighting, or tapping an item on a page to initiate a Google Search, you’ll have to go through additional steps, making the feature less exciting to use. You’ll need to tap the three-dot menu and then select the “Search Screen with Google Lens” option to initiate searches. The same procedure applies to both the Chrome and Google apps. In the future, a Lens icon will appear in the address bar in Chrome, similar to the Lens experience for the desktop version of the browser. Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Performing a “Search Screen with Google Lens” in the Google app on iPhone. Image source: GoogleThe feature won’t work outside these two apps, which is another big difference. You can invoke Circle to Search anywhere on the screen on Android because it’s Google’s operating system. Google doesn’t have the same freedom in iOS. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll quickly be able to use this new gesture for the iPhone to find out more details about anything you stumble upon online. The new screen search functionality is rolling out this week, and it’ll be available globally to iPhone users with Chrome and the Google app installed. Google also announced a Google Lens feature I’m not too excited about: AI Overviews will begin to appear “more often” in Lens results. You cannot opt out of this, as Google will gradually introduce it to more Lens experiences. AI Overviews in Lens will be available initially to English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are already available in Google Search. Initially, it will be confined to the Google app on iPhone and Android, but the Chrome mobile and desktop apps will also get it.

When Google unveiled Circle to Search in early 2024, I said I wanted a similar feature on the iPhone. More than a year later, Circle to Search is available on plenty of Galaxy, Pixel, and other Android phones, where Google controls the underlying operating system. But Circle to Search can’t come to the iPhone in the same way that it works on Android. However, Google on Wednesday launched the next best thing for iPhones. It’s called “Search Screen with Google Lens” instead of Circle to Search, but it works in a similar way. The feature is available inside the Google and Chrome apps on the iPhone, but it also supports gestures that are similar to Circle to Search. Unfortunately, invoking the iPhone version of Circle to Search isn’t as simple as using it on Android devices. Before drawing, highlighting, or tapping an item on a page to initiate a Google Search, you’ll have to go through additional steps, making the feature less exciting to use. You’ll need to tap the three-dot menu and then select the “Search Screen with Google Lens” option to initiate searches. The same procedure applies to both the Chrome and Google apps. In the future, a Lens icon will appear in the address bar in Chrome, similar to the Lens experience for the desktop version of the browser. Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Performing a “Search Screen with Google Lens” in the Google app on iPhone. Image source: GoogleThe feature won’t work outside these two apps, which is another big difference. You can invoke Circle to Search anywhere on the screen on Android because it’s Google’s operating system. Google doesn’t have the same freedom in iOS. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll quickly be able to use this new gesture for the iPhone to find out more details about anything you stumble upon online. The new screen search functionality is rolling out this week, and it’ll be available globally to iPhone users with Chrome and the Google app installed. Google also announced a Google Lens feature I’m not too excited about: AI Overviews will begin to appear “more often” in Lens results. You cannot opt out of this, as Google will gradually introduce it to more Lens experiences. AI Overviews in Lens will be available initially to English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are already available in Google Search. Initially, it will be confined to the Google app on iPhone and Android, but the Chrome mobile and desktop apps will also get it.

When Google unveiled Circle to Search in early 2024, I said I wanted a similar feature on the iPhone. More than a year later, Circle to Search is available on plenty of Galaxy, Pixel, and other Android phones, where Google controls the underlying operating system. But Circle to Search can’t come to the iPhone in the same way that it works on Android. However, Google on Wednesday launched the next best thing for iPhones. It’s called “Search Screen with Google Lens” instead of Circle to Search, but it works in a similar way. The feature is available inside the Google and Chrome apps on the iPhone, but it also supports gestures that are similar to Circle to Search. Unfortunately, invoking the iPhone version of Circle to Search isn’t as simple as using it on Android devices. Before drawing, highlighting, or tapping an item on a page to initiate a Google Search, you’ll have to go through additional steps, making the feature less exciting to use. You’ll need to tap the three-dot menu and then select the “Search Screen with Google Lens” option to initiate searches. The same procedure applies to both the Chrome and Google apps. In the future, a Lens icon will appear in the address bar in Chrome, similar to the Lens experience for the desktop version of the browser. Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Performing a “Search Screen with Google Lens” in the Google app on iPhone. Image source: GoogleThe feature won’t work outside these two apps, which is another big difference. You can invoke Circle to Search anywhere on the screen on Android because it’s Google’s operating system. Google doesn’t have the same freedom in iOS. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll quickly be able to use this new gesture for the iPhone to find out more details about anything you stumble upon online. The new screen search functionality is rolling out this week, and it’ll be available globally to iPhone users with Chrome and the Google app installed. Google also announced a Google Lens feature I’m not too excited about: AI Overviews will begin to appear “more often” in Lens results. You cannot opt out of this, as Google will gradually introduce it to more Lens experiences. AI Overviews in Lens will be available initially to English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are already available in Google Search. Initially, it will be confined to the Google app on iPhone and Android, but the Chrome mobile and desktop apps will also get it.

Meanwhile, Google Lens can now recognize more unique images. Chrome on the iPhone and iPad already has an instance of Lens that lets you take a picture or analyze a screenshot. You can now “Search Screen with Google Lens” as you’re browsing the web or watching a video. Instead of manually taking a screenshot, you’ll find that new shortcut in the three-dot overflow menu. A shimmer will appear over the screen and you’ll be prompted to “Circle or tap anywhere to search. ” (You can also highlight text. ) Web results, including AI Overviews, appear in a bottom sheet, with pages opening a new tab. This is essentially Android’s Circle to Search capability, and also coming to the Google app on iOS as “Search this Screen” in the three-dot menu (top-right corner). Google Lens Screen Search is rolling out now with Chrome 133 for iOS and the latest version of the Google (Search) app. Meanwhile, Google credits “advanced AI models” as allowing Lens to “go much further and provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images. ” Results will take the form of AI Overviews, with the expanded recognition meaning that users don’t need to manually append a question. Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood. Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. Expanded recognition is rolling out this week for “English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available. ” You’ll first see this with the Google app on Android and iOS before coming to the desktop and mobile Chrome version.

Meanwhile, Google Lens can now recognize more unique images. Chrome on the iPhone and iPad already has an instance of Lens that lets you take a picture or analyze a screenshot. You can now “Search Screen with Google Lens” as you’re browsing the web or watching a video. Instead of manually taking a screenshot, you’ll find that new shortcut in the three-dot overflow menu. A shimmer will appear over the screen and you’ll be prompted to “Circle or tap anywhere to search. ” (You can also highlight text. ) Web results, including AI Overviews, appear in a bottom sheet, with pages opening a new tab. This is essentially Android’s Circle to Search capability, and also coming to the Google app on iOS as “Search this Screen” in the three-dot menu (top-right corner). Google Lens Screen Search is rolling out now with Chrome 133 for iOS and the latest version of the Google (Search) app. Meanwhile, Google credits “advanced AI models” as allowing Lens to “go much further and provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images. ” Results will take the form of AI Overviews, with the expanded recognition meaning that users don’t need to manually append a question. Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood. Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. Expanded recognition is rolling out this week for “English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available. ” You’ll first see this with the Google app on Android and iOS before coming to the desktop and mobile Chrome version.

Meanwhile, Google Lens can now recognize more unique images. Chrome on the iPhone and iPad already has an instance of Lens that lets you take a picture or analyze a screenshot. You can now “Search Screen with Google Lens” as you’re browsing the web or watching a video. Instead of manually taking a screenshot, you’ll find that new shortcut in the three-dot overflow menu. A shimmer will appear over the screen and you’ll be prompted to “Circle or tap anywhere to search. ” (You can also highlight text. ) Web results, including AI Overviews, appear in a bottom sheet, with pages opening a new tab. This is essentially Android’s Circle to Search capability, and also coming to the Google app on iOS as “Search this Screen” in the three-dot menu (top-right corner). Google Lens Screen Search is rolling out now with Chrome 133 for iOS and the latest version of the Google (Search) app. Meanwhile, Google credits “advanced AI models” as allowing Lens to “go much further and provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images. ” Results will take the form of AI Overviews, with the expanded recognition meaning that users don’t need to manually append a question. Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood. Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. Expanded recognition is rolling out this week for “English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available. ” You’ll first see this with the Google app on Android and iOS before coming to the desktop and mobile Chrome version.

PCMag UK NewsMobile Phones Google Lens Update Lets You 'Search Your Screen' on iPhones The feature appears to be a limited version of Android's Circle to Search, contained within a few apps. Will it convince some Apple lovers to jump ship, or at least ditch Safari? By Emily Forlini Feb 19, 2025 (Credit: Google) Google is rolling out a new search experience this week for iOS, which lets iPhone users look up information about a portion of their screen with AI. Google Lens can already perform searches with photos. This new functionality adds the ability to search a visual on the screen—not from a new photo. It's helpful if you're reading about one topic, but something else pops up on the screen that you want a quick explanation of without having to start a disruptive new search. \"Whether you’re reading an article, shopping for a product, or watching a video, you can use this feature to quickly perform a visual search while browsing, without having to take a screenshot or open a new tab,\" says Google. It's only available within Chrome and Google on iOS, and it's a part of the Lens functionality. To try it, tap the three-dot menu in Lens and select \"Search this Screen. \" Then, you can highlight a portion of the screen by \"using whatever gesture comes naturally,\" such as drawing a circle around it or tapping it. Google Lens AI Overviews(Credit: Google)It could be considered a limited version of Google's Circle to Search feature, which debuted in January 2024 and is available on select Android devices. That feature allows you to search what's on the screen within any app, not just the Chrome or Google apps. So iPhone users are getting a taste of the Android life, but only if they choose to ditch Safari and use the Chrome or Google app. Thanks to Google's \"advanced AI models,\" Lens can provide more information about more images, even obscure ones, than ever. It surfaces the information in the same format as the AI Overviews that have lived at the top of the typical Google search results page since last May. Like AI Overviews, it's only available for English-language users and in eligible countries. \"Perhaps you come across an interesting-looking car and want to learn more about the strange texture on its hood,\" Google says. \"Just tap the camera icon in the Search bar to snap a photo with Lens. You’ll get an AI Overview to help you quickly make sense of what you’re looking at, along with links to helpful resources on the web. \"The latest image search capabilities from Apple came with December's iOS 18. 2 update. Now, iPhone 16 owners can press the Camera Control button, snap a picture of an object, and look up information about it with Apple Intelligence. iPhone 16 Camera Control button(Credit: Emily Forlini) More Inside PCMag. com Apple Debuts $599 iPhone 16e With Its First Custom Modem How to Quickly Launch Apps on Your Android Phone With Back-Tap 5 Major Changes I Expect for the Apple iPhone SE 4 Indoors and in Cars: How Globalstar Plans to Upgrade iPhone Satellite Features 5 Tips to Boost Your Android Phone's Battery Life About Emily Forlini My ExpertiseI'm the expert at PCMag for all things electric vehicles and AI.

The company describes the tool as an AI co-scientist. It’s powered by Gemini 2. 0, the latest iteration of Google’s flagship large language model family. The LLMs in the series can process multimodal data and have a tool use feature, which allows them to perform actions in external systems such as databases. Researchers interact with Google’s AI co-scientist through a chatbot interface. The user specifies a goal, such as finding new clinical applications for an existing medicine, and the tool suggests potential ways of realizing that goal. The software generates a multi-paragraph research plan and finds academic papers with data relevant to the project. Users can customize the co-scientist’s output in various ways. Instead of simply providing a research goal, a scientist could enter a proposal for reaching that goal and ask the AI to review the idea. Additionally, users can provide feedback on the co-scientist’s initial prompt response to help it make improvements. “Beyond standard literature review, summarization and ‘deep research’ tools, the AI co-scientist system is intended to uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals,” Google researchers Juraj Gottweis and Vivek Natarajan wrote in a blog post. Under the hood, the AI co-scientist is powered by more than a half dozen AI agents. Those are machine learning programs that can perform actions with a high degree of autonomy. Each one carries out a different subset of the tasks involved in generating a research plan. The first agent, dubbed Generation, analyzes the scientific phenomenon the user wishes to study and generates several hypotheses that attempt to explain it. A second agent called Ranking then refines those hypotheses with the help of several auxiliary AI agents. One of the auxiliary agents, Proximity, removes duplicate research ideas. Another reviews the remaining research proposals with the help of publicly available scientific data. There’s also a third agent, dubbed Evolution, that can simplify the AI co-scientist’s output to make it easier to understand. The system uses an approach called test-time compute to generate hypotheses. The technique makes it possible to increase the quality of an AI model’s output by boosting the amount of time and infrastructure it invests in generating prompt responses. Besides the Gemini 2. 0 LLM series on which the co-scientist is based, test-time compute is also supported by several competing models including OpenAI’s o1. The agents the co-scientist uses to perform research are coordinated by a supervisor agent. According to Google, one of its responsibilities is collecting statistics about the computations involved in processing a user prompt. Those statistics help the co-scientist determine when it should end processing and display its prompt response. To test the co-scientist’s capabilities, Google asked a group of scientists to present the system with 15 research goals. The participants determined that the AI’s responses “have higher potential for novelty and impact” than the output of competing models. Google is also applying its Gemini models to other complex, domain-specific tasks. Last May, the search giant introduced Med-Gemini, a version of the LLM series fine-tuned on healthcare data. The models in the lineup can analyze x-rays and answer clinical questions using information from academic papers.

The company describes the tool as an AI co-scientist. It’s powered by Gemini 2. 0, the latest iteration of Google’s flagship large language model family. The LLMs in the series can process multimodal data and have a tool use feature, which allows them to perform actions in external systems such as databases. Researchers interact with Google’s AI co-scientist through a chatbot interface. The user specifies a goal, such as finding new clinical applications for an existing medicine, and the tool suggests potential ways of realizing that goal. The software generates a multi-paragraph research plan and finds academic papers with data relevant to the project. Users can customize the co-scientist’s output in various ways. Instead of simply providing a research goal, a scientist could enter a proposal for reaching that goal and ask the AI to review the idea. Additionally, users can provide feedback on the co-scientist’s initial prompt response to help it make improvements. “Beyond standard literature review, summarization and ‘deep research’ tools, the AI co-scientist system is intended to uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals,” Google researchers Juraj Gottweis and Vivek Natarajan wrote in a blog post. Under the hood, the AI co-scientist is powered by more than a half dozen AI agents. Those are machine learning programs that can perform actions with a high degree of autonomy. Each one carries out a different subset of the tasks involved in generating a research plan. The first agent, dubbed Generation, analyzes the scientific phenomenon the user wishes to study and generates several hypotheses that attempt to explain it. A second agent called Ranking then refines those hypotheses with the help of several auxiliary AI agents. One of the auxiliary agents, Proximity, removes duplicate research ideas. Another reviews the remaining research proposals with the help of publicly available scientific data. There’s also a third agent, dubbed Evolution, that can simplify the AI co-scientist’s output to make it easier to understand. The system uses an approach called test-time compute to generate hypotheses. The technique makes it possible to increase the quality of an AI model’s output by boosting the amount of time and infrastructure it invests in generating prompt responses. Besides the Gemini 2. 0 LLM series on which the co-scientist is based, test-time compute is also supported by several competing models including OpenAI’s o1. The agents the co-scientist uses to perform research are coordinated by a supervisor agent. According to Google, one of its responsibilities is collecting statistics about the computations involved in processing a user prompt. Those statistics help the co-scientist determine when it should end processing and display its prompt response. To test the co-scientist’s capabilities, Google asked a group of scientists to present the system with 15 research goals. The participants determined that the AI’s responses “have higher potential for novelty and impact” than the output of competing models. Google is also applying its Gemini models to other complex, domain-specific tasks. Last May, the search giant introduced Med-Gemini, a version of the LLM series fine-tuned on healthcare data. The models in the lineup can analyze x-rays and answer clinical questions using information from academic papers.

These dates go back several years as seen in the (left) screenshot below, so Google Tasks has been storing this information from the beginning. This is a nice quality-of-life improvement for checking when you recently accomplished something, especially reminders without due dates.

These dates go back several years as seen in the (left) screenshot below, so Google Tasks has been storing this information from the beginning. This is a nice quality-of-life improvement for checking when you recently accomplished something, especially reminders without due dates. It’s a small step towards making Google Tasks less of a basic to-do app. As of today, completed dates are appearing in the standalone Google Tasks for Android and iOS (which has yet to be redesigned). It’s not currently available for the integrated Google Calendar experience on the web and Android. Meanwhile, Google is testing a count of uncompleted tasks next to list names in the top tab switcher. This vertical pill-shaped container appears on everything but your current list. We’re only seeing this on one device, and it’s a bit distracting. Given the prominence, it feels more like a notice for tasks that have missed their due date. The option to disable this would be nice, with the app today only offering settings for Notifications and Theme. Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed.

These dates go back several years as seen in the (left) screenshot below, so Google Tasks has been storing this information from the beginning. This is a nice quality-of-life improvement for checking when you recently accomplished something, especially reminders without due dates. It’s a small step towards making Google Tasks less of a basic to-do app. As of today, completed dates are appearing in the standalone Google Tasks for Android and iOS (which has yet to be redesigned). It’s not currently available for the integrated Google Calendar experience on the web and Android. Meanwhile, Google is testing a count of uncompleted tasks next to list names in the top tab switcher. This vertical pill-shaped container appears on everything but your current list. We’re only seeing this on one device, and it’s a bit distracting. Given the prominence, it feels more like a notice for tasks that have missed their due date. The option to disable this would be nice, with the app today only offering settings for Notifications and Theme. Add 9to5Google to your Google News feed.

In a short support post today, the company announced how “Google Photos is expanding the group of eligible devices where you can display albums in a slideshow on the ambient or idle screen of your device. ” The new supported form factors are: Smart TVs, Tablets, Fridges, and Photo frames. The existing list includes: Google TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Pixel Tablet, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max. These devices offer a Google-built slideshow experience that can be controlled via the Google Photos app (Settings \u003e Apps \u0026 devices \u003e Photo frames). It can also be set via the Google Home app. It now seems like something similar will be coming to third-party devices. Some smart fridges already offer Google Photos integration, while bringing Google Photos to non-Android/Google TV sets is a good idea and dedicated photo frame devices are always popular. Google today is not announcing any of the new devices or integrations.

In a short support post today, the company announced how “Google Photos is expanding the group of eligible devices where you can display albums in a slideshow on the ambient or idle screen of your device. ” The new supported form factors are: Smart TVs, Tablets, Fridges, and Photo frames. The existing list includes: Google TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Pixel Tablet, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max. These devices offer a Google-built slideshow experience that can be controlled via the Google Photos app (Settings \u003e Apps \u0026 devices \u003e Photo frames). It can also be set via the Google Home app. It now seems like something similar will be coming to third-party devices. Some smart fridges already offer Google Photos integration, while bringing Google Photos to non-Android/Google TV sets is a good idea and dedicated photo frame devices are always popular. Google today is not announcing any of the new devices or integrations.

In a short support post today, the company announced how “Google Photos is expanding the group of eligible devices where you can display albums in a slideshow on the ambient or idle screen of your device. ” The new supported form factors are: Smart TVs, Tablets, Fridges, and Photo frames. The existing list includes: Google TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Pixel Tablet, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max. These devices offer a Google-built slideshow experience that can be controlled via the Google Photos app (Settings \u003e Apps \u0026 devices \u003e Photo frames). It can also be set via the Google Home app. It now seems like something similar will be coming to third-party devices. Some smart fridges already offer Google Photos integration, while bringing Google Photos to non-Android/Google TV sets is a good idea and dedicated photo frame devices are always popular. Google today is not announcing any of the new devices or integrations.

The two tech companies have recently made enormous changes and removals to their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the United States, since Donald Trump became President of the United States for the second time. This marks a significant change for the tech giants, who have previously had robust DEI programs and initiatives, and have participated in Mardi Gras for several years, including Meta’s participation in the 2023 World Pride. Meta was also a media partner and Google was a supporting partner of Mardi Gras in 2024. The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, renowned for its vibrant celebrations and advocacy for LGBTQIA+ rights, has stringent partnership criteria, outlined by its Ethical Charter. Meta’s recent policy revisions have raised concerns within the LGBTQIA+ community. In the last month, the tech giant has removed its Pride themes, and rolled back its hate speech policy to permit users on Facebook and Instagram to call transgender or gay people “mentally ill. ” Similarly, Google has scaled back its DEI programs, including the removal of LGBTQIA+ holidays from its online and mobile calendars. These significant rollbacks have led to questions and serious concerns from the LGBTQIA + community about the companies’ dedication to the community’s rights, safety, and inclusivity. Meta \u0026 Google at Mardi Gras: Not a withdrawal, but no contract renewals City Hub understands that the tech companies’ contracts with Mardi Gras had expired, but they were not approached with new ones. Every participating float and partner must adhere to the Mardi Gras’ Ethical Charter process, and with the ongoing rollbacks to DEI programs in the US, its likely that Meta and Google no longer meet the requirements in the Charter. “For half a decade Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras has called upon our Ethical Charter framework during the final stages of prospective partnership opportunities. This ensures we enter into relationships with organisations’ who share our values and commitment to our communities, and who actively advance our communities’ missions through their audiences, processes, staff and strategies,” reads the Charter’s introduction. “Simply put, the Ethical Charter framework is the foundation our relationship is built upon and reassures our communities of organisations alignment and active allyship. ” The Charter rates each organisation between 1 and 5 in different categories, to ensure that the ‘prospective partner’ actually aligns with Mardi Gras’ values. The first of these categories is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. “We want to partner with industry leaders in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion – who champion DEI as an integral part of their organisation,” reads the charter. The other categories are: Human Rights and Sustainability – “We want to partner with organisations… who share a commitment to human rights” Authenticity and Integrity – “We want to partner with organisations who share a deep and authentic commitment to our communities, who align with our values, and are genuinely invested in seeing our communities thrive”) and Collaboration – “We want to partner with long-standing supporters of our community, who want to stick by us for the years to come…”.

Meta \u0026 Google at Mardi Gras: Not a withdrawal, but no contract renewals City Hub understands that the tech companies’ contracts with Mardi Gras had expired, but they were not approached with new ones. Every participating float and partner must adhere to the Mardi Gras’ Ethical Charter process, and with the ongoing rollbacks to DEI programs in the US, its likely that Meta and Google no longer meet the requirements in the Charter. “For half a decade Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras has called upon our Ethical Charter framework during the final stages of prospective partnership opportunities. This ensures we enter into relationships with organisations’ who share our values and commitment to our communities, and who actively advance our communities’ missions through their audiences, processes, staff and strategies,” reads the Charter’s introduction. “Simply put, the Ethical Charter framework is the foundation our relationship is built upon and reassures our communities of organisations alignment and active allyship. ” The Charter rates each organisation between 1 and 5 in different categories, to ensure that the ‘prospective partner’ actually aligns with Mardi Gras’ values. The first of these categories is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. “We want to partner with industry leaders in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion – who champion DEI as an integral part of their organisation,” reads the charter. The other categories are: Human Rights and Sustainability – “We want to partner with organisations… who share a commitment to human rights” Authenticity and Integrity – “We want to partner with organisations who share a deep and authentic commitment to our communities, who align with our values, and are genuinely invested in seeing our communities thrive”) and Collaboration – “We want to partner with long-standing supporters of our community, who want to stick by us for the years to come…”.

The two tech companies have recently made enormous changes and removals to their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the United States, since Donald Trump became President of the United States for the second time. This marks a significant change for the tech giants, who have previously had robust DEI programs and initiatives, and have participated in Mardi Gras for several years, including Meta’s participation in the 2023 World Pride. Meta was also a media partner and Google was a supporting partner of Mardi Gras in 2024. The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, renowned for its vibrant celebrations and advocacy for LGBTQIA+ rights, has stringent partnership criteria, outlined by its Ethical Charter. Meta’s recent policy revisions have raised concerns within the LGBTQIA+ community. In the last month, the tech giant has removed its Pride themes, and rolled back its hate speech policy to permit users on Facebook and Instagram to call transgender or gay people “mentally ill. ” Similarly, Google has scaled back its DEI programs, including the removal of LGBTQIA+ holidays from its online and mobile calendars. These significant rollbacks have led to questions and serious concerns from the LGBTQIA + community about the companies’ dedication to the community’s rights, safety, and inclusivity. Meta \u0026 Google at Mardi Gras: Not a withdrawal, but no contract renewals City Hub understands that the tech companies’ contracts with Mardi Gras had expired, but they were not approached with new ones.

The first of these categories is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. “We want to partner with industry leaders in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion – who champion DEI as an integral part of their organisation,” reads the charter.

Advertisment TECH BUSINESS Google Play Store: Major Jolt to China! Indian Govt Blocks Over 100 Apps, Check What's Impacted Google Play Store : The Indian government is set to block 119 apps, primarily video and voice chat platforms linked to developers in China and Hong Kong, under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act. Neha Kumari 20 Feb 2025 19:15 IST Follow Us New Update Google The Indian government is set to block 119 apps, primarily video and voice chat platforms linked to developers in China and Hong Kong, under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act. This development comes from data disclosed by Google on the Lumen Database, a Harvard University-operated platform that tracks content removal requests. Only 15 Apps Blocked So Far, Majority Still Active Despite the directive, only 15 of the 119 apps have been withheld in India so far, according to a report by Moneycontrol. The remaining apps are still accessible for download as of February 20, 2025. While the majority of affected apps have ties to China and Hong Kong, a smaller number originate from Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Government's National Security Standpoint The blocking order is issued under Section 69A of the IT Act, which empowers the Indian government to restrict access to online content if deemed a threat to national security, sovereignty, or public order. Similar measures have been taken in the past, especially following geopolitical tensions with China. App Developers Respond to Blocking Order Three developers affected by the ban have confirmed that they were informed about the action by Google. They expressed their willingness to work with the Indian government to address the issue and potentially resolve compliance concerns. Advertisment Keep abreast with all the Latest News Updates.
